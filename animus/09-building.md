An NPC can build a schematic block by block. It walks to each block with its normal [navigation](/animus/05-movement-mounts-riding), faces it, swings its arm with the block in its hand and places it, and nearby players hear the block's place sound. A door, bed, tall flower or double chest goes down whole, never one half at a time. To reach blocks high above the ground, the NPC puts up [scaffolding](#scaffolding), climbs it and takes it down again. Several NPCs can share one build. Builds are saved, so they continue after a restart, and every block a build changes can be undone.

Builds run on Spigot and Paper 26.1.2, 26.2 and 26.3, and on Fabric, NeoForge and Forge servers for the same versions. They are not available on Folia; see [platforms](#platforms).

## Schematic files

Put schematic files in the `schematics` folder of the Animus data folder: `plugins/Animus/schematics/` on Bukkit, `config/animus/schematics/` on mod servers. No other plugin or mod is needed to read them.

| Format | Extension | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sponge schematic, versions 1, 2 and 3 | `.schem` | The format WorldEdit and most editors save. The saved offset is used by `anchor=schematic`. |
| Vanilla structure | `.nbt` | Saved by a structure block. Structure void cells leave the world as it is. If the file holds several palettes, the first is used. |
| Old MCEdit schematic | `.schematic` | Not supported. These files store numeric block IDs from before Minecraft 1.13, which cannot be read safely. Open the file in an editor and save it as `.schem`. A `.schematic` file that is really a Sponge schematic is read normally. |

Reading is bounded. A file larger than `maximumFileBytes`, a box larger than `maximumVolume` cells or `maximumSide` blocks on any side, a palette larger than `maximumPalette`, more than 64 MiB once decompressed, NBT nested deeper than 64 levels or more than 2,000,000 NBT tags is refused with the reason. Nothing is placed until the whole file is read.

Each block state is matched to the blocks the server has. A block under an older name, such as `minecraft:grass`, is tried under its current name. A state whose properties the server does not have is placed with the block's default properties. A block the server does not know at all is left out and reported, and its cells stay as they are. `/animus build inspect <schematic>` shows all of this before you build.

Chest, furnace, sign and banner contents in a schematic are not copied: the block is placed empty. Entities in a schematic are not placed.

## Commands

All build commands need `animus.admin`, except `donate`, which needs `animus.build.donate`. They are the same on every platform.

```none
/animus build status                            status of the build system
/animus build list                              every build and its progress
/animus build schematics                        schematic files in the folder
/animus build inspect <schematic>               size, block count and unknown blocks
/animus build start <npc-id> schematic=<file> [at=<x>,<y>,<z>] [option=value...]
/animus build start <npc-id>                    start the build saved in the NPC's definition
/animus build status|pause|resume|cancel|undo|survey <build>
/animus build team add|remove <build> <npc-id>
/animus build donate <build>                    give the items in your main hand
```

A build is named after the NPC that leads it, and `<build>` may also be any NPC on its team. The build starts where the leader stands, or at `at=`. An NPC can work on one build at a time. Starting a new build for an NPC whose last build has finished, failed, been cancelled or been undone discards that old build's record and undo data.

```none
/animus build start mason schematic=tower.schem at=120,64,-40 rotation=90 excavate=true materials=donate
/animus build team add mason helper
/animus build survey mason
/animus build pause mason
```

### Options

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `anchor` | `center` | `center` puts the middle of the footprint on the origin and the lowest filled layer at the origin's height. `corner` puts the schematic's lowest north-west corner on the origin. `schematic` uses the offset saved in the file. |
| `rotation` | `0` | Turn clockwise, seen from above: `0`, `90`, `180` or `270`. Stairs, doors, logs, rails, fences, signs and other directional blocks turn with the build. |
| `mirror` | `none` | `x` swaps east and west, `z` swaps north and south. Mirroring happens before rotation. |
| `offset` | `0,0,0` | Moves the whole build by `<x>,<y>,<z>` blocks, up to 1024 each way. `yoffset=<y>` changes only the height. |
| `pattern` | `spiral` | The order of blocks within one layer: `spiral` (outside in), `reversespiral` (inside out), `linear` (row by row from the north-west corner) or `reverselinear`. |
| `layers` | `1` | How many layers form one group. |
| `groupall` | `false` | Treat the whole build as one group. |
| `ignoreair` | `false` | Do not place the schematic's air. |
| `ignoreliquids` | `false` | Do not place water or lava. |
| `excavate` | `false` | First clear the whole box from the top down, keeping blocks that already match. |
| `speed` | `2` | Walking speed, 1 to 5 blocks per second. |
| `interval` | `4` | Ticks between two blocks placed by one NPC, 1 to 200. |
| `reach` | `4.5` | How close, 2 to 6 blocks, the NPC must be to place a block. |
| `timeout` | `10` | Seconds, 1 to 300, an NPC may walk toward one block. After that it is moved next to the block, or places it from where it stands when there is no clear spot. |
| `scaffolding` | `true` | Put up and climb scaffolding to reach blocks too high to reach from the ground. See [scaffolding](#scaffolding). |
| `hold` | `true` | Show the block being placed (or a pickaxe while digging) in the NPC's hand. |
| `silent` | `false` | No place sound. |
| `materials` | `creative` | `creative` places blocks for free. `donate` uses items players hand over. `container` takes items from the container at `container=<x>,<y>,<z>`. |

### Build order

The build goes up one group of layers at a time. Inside each group the order is:

1. air, from the top of the group down;
2. solid blocks, bottom up;
3. falling blocks such as sand, gravel and concrete powder;
4. blocks that hang on others: torches, lanterns, doors, trapdoors, buttons, levers, pressure plates, redstone dust, repeaters, comparators, rails, signs, banners, beds, carpets, plants, crops, vines and similar;
5. water and lava last.

Blocks are placed without updating their neighbours, so a torch or a door does not pop off while the wall behind it is not built yet, and water does not flow until a neighbour changes. Excavation, when turned on, runs before the first group.

A block that already matches the schematic is skipped and costs nothing. Each NPC takes the next block of the current step; the next step starts only when every block of the current one is done.

### Doors, beds and other objects of several blocks

Some blocks are one object over several cells. The build places each of them as one step, with every cell in the same tick, the lowest cell first:

| Object | Cells |
| --- | --- |
| Doors, tall flowers and grass (sunflower, lilac, rose bush, peony, tall grass, large fern), tall seagrass, pitcher plants, small dripleaf | Lower and upper half (`half=lower` and `half=upper`) |
| Beds | Foot and head (`part`), the head in the direction the bed faces |
| Double chests and trapped chests | Left and right half (`type=left` and `type=right`) |
| Extended pistons and sticky pistons | The piston and its head |
| Big dripleaf | Every stem in the column and the leaf on top |

Facing, hinge and the other properties of each cell come from the schematic, and a bed is always placed empty. The object goes in the step of its lowest cell, so a door goes up with the layer of its lower half. When a schematic holds only one half, the build adds the other half where it belongs; when that cell holds another block in the schematic, the lone half is left out instead. Nothing is ever placed half done: when protection refuses one cell, or the build cannot pay for every cell, none of it is placed.

When a build replaces or clears one half of such an object already in the world, the other half goes too, even outside the build's box. Undo puts every object back, or leaves it, as a whole.

### Materials

With `materials=donate`, a build waits when it needs an item it does not have, and its status says which item and how many. Players hand items over with `/animus build donate <builde` while holding them; the build takes only items it still needs and leaves the rest in the hand. `animus.build.donate` is given to everyone by default. `survey` lists what the rest of the build needs and what it holds. The list is an upper bound: blocks already in place are only counted off when the build gets to them.

With `materials=container`, items come from the container block at `container=`. The container must be in a loaded chunk; when it is missing or unloaded the build waits.

The item for each block comes from the server: a wall torch needs a torch, wheat needs seeds. A door, tall plant or bed costs one item for the whole object, a double chest costs two chests, a piston's head is free, a double slab needs two slabs, and blocks with several pieces in one cell (candles, sea pickles, eggs, snow layers, petals) need one item per piece. Water and lava need a water or lava bucket each, and the bucket is used up. A block that no item places, such as fire or a portal, is skipped in these modes and counted under `no-item`. Undo is free and returns no items.

## Scaffolding

A block the NPC cannot reach from the ground, because it is more than about `reach` blocks above the NPC's feet with nowhere to stand near it, or because the NPC cannot walk to the only place that reaches it, is built from scaffolding:

1. The build looks for a place to stand within `reach` of the block, one block under it or a little higher, that also reaches as many of the next blocks as possible. Under that place it plans a column of `minecraft:scaffolding` from the ground. When the column cannot go straight down, for example over a roof, it plans a column beside it and a level walkway of at most 6 blocks out to the place, as far as scaffolding reaches in the game. Scaffolding only goes into empty cells that the build does not fill: outside the schematic's box, or where the schematic has air or nothing.
2. The NPC walks to the foot of the column, places a scaffolding block in the cell it stands in, climbs onto it, and repeats up to the top. On a walkway it places each block in front of it and walks onto it. It holds scaffolding while it does this, faces each block and swings, and climbs at most 2.35 blocks per second.
3. It builds every block it reaches from the top. When the next block is a little higher or lower, the column grows or shrinks under it; when it is somewhere else, the scaffolding comes down and goes up again near that block.
4. Taking it down runs the other way: the NPC steps back off each walkway block before removing it, then climbs down the column, removing the cell it stands in, until it is on the ground.

The build finishes only when all its scaffolding is down. `pause` and `cancel` also send the NPCs down with their scaffolding. Scaffolding whose NPC has left the team or the world, scaffolding of a failed build, and scaffolding still standing when the server stops is removed at once, without the NPC. Scaffolding recorded with a build that did not stop cleanly is removed when the server starts again. While scaffolding stands, `status` shows `scaffolding=<blocks>`.

Each scaffolding block is checked with protection like any other change and recorded for undo. When protection refuses a block or another block takes its place, the scaffolding comes down and the NPC reaches the block the other way: after `timeout` it is moved next to the block, or places it from where it stands. The same happens with `scaffolding=false` or when no scaffolding fits. `undo` removes scaffolding still standing; scaffolding the build already took down is not put up again.

With `materials=creative` scaffolding is free. Otherwise each block takes one `minecraft:scaffolding` from the build's materials (or the container), and every block that comes down goes back to the build's materials, so one column's worth is used again and again. `survey` and `donate` count enough scaffolding for one column from the origin to one block under the highest block left. A build that runs out of scaffolding waits with `needs 1 minecraft:scaffolding to put up scaffolding` while the NPC stays on its column.

Walking NPCs climb scaffolding, ladders and vines with their normal navigation, so a patrol can use them too.

## Pausing, waiting and undo

A build waits on its own, and starts again on its own, when:

- a block lies in a chunk that is not loaded. Animus never loads or generates a chunk for a build;
- a build that uses `donate` or `container` runs short of an item, or its container is not there;
- no NPC on its team is active in the build's world.

`pause` stops a build until `resume`. `cancel` stops it for good. A paused, waiting, cancelled or finished build keeps its undo record.

`undo` puts back every block the build changed, newest first, including blocks it dug out. A block that someone changed after the build placed it is left alone and counted under `kept`. Undo does not walk: blocks change at `undoPerTick` per tick, and wait for unloaded chunks the same way. The undo record holds at most `maximumUndoEntries` changes. Past that the build still runs, its status shows `undo=... (full)`, and undo can only revert the changes it recorded.

## Protection

Every block change asks the platform's protection first. If the answer is no, the block is skipped and counted under `denied`; if protection fails or gives no answer, the change is refused.

- On Bukkit and Paper with WorldGuard, the NPC is checked as a non-member, as in [combat](/animus/08-combat#protection), and may change a block only where a non-member player could: outside every region, or where `build` and `block-place` (or `block-break` when a block turns to air) are allowed at the block. A region without those flags is closed to the NPC, as it is to any non-member. If WorldGuard is installed but disabled, at startup or later, or cannot be used, every change is refused. Other claim plugins are not asked.
- Without WorldGuard, and on Fabric, NeoForge and Forge servers, which have no standard protection API, every change is allowed. `/animus build status` shows which protection is in use.

## Behaviors

The built-in [`animus:build`](/animus/07-behaviors#actions) action starts, pauses, resumes, cancels or undoes the NPC's build:

```json
{"type": "action", "capability": "animus:build", "arguments": {"operation": "start", "schematic": "hut.nbt", "rotation": 180, "materials": "donate"}}
```

A start without `schematic` uses the NPC's `animus:builder` section. Two triggers fire for every NPC on the team: `build_finished` when the last block is placed, and `build_paused` when the build is paused or starts waiting.

## Saved build in a definition

An NPC definition can hold a build request, which `/animus build start <npc-id>` runs:

```json
"modules": {
  "animus:builder": {
    "schematic": "tower.schem",
    "origin": {"x": 120, "y": 64, "z": -40},
    "options": {"rotation": 90, "excavate": true, "materials": "donate", "pattern": "spiral", "layers": 1}
  }
}
```

`options` uses the JSON names of the options above: `anchor`, `rotation`, `mirror`, `offset` (`{"x", "y", "z"}`), `pattern`, `layers`, `groupAll`, `ignoreAir`, `ignoreLiquids`, `excavate`, `speed`, `placeIntervalTicks`, `reach`, `moveTimeoutSeconds`, `holdBlock`, `silent`, `materials`, `container` and `scaffolding`. An imported section also needs `"reviewAccepted": true`. A saved build never starts on its own.

## Saved state

Each build is saved under `state/builds/<build>.json`, with its undo record in `state/builds/<build>/undo-00000.json` and following files of 4096 changes each. The files are written through the same crash-safe journal as other generated state, a few seconds after a change and at once when a build pauses or ends. Do not edit them.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "mason",
  "team": ["mason", "helper"],
  "world": "0f6c1a52-6e1e-4f0a-9d7c-2b0b8a1d3e44",
  "origin": {"x": 120, "y": 64, "z": -40},
  "schematic": "tower.schem",
  "schematicSha256": "5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592...",
  "options": {"anchor": "center", "rotation": 90, "mirror": "none", "offset": {"x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0}, "pattern": "spiral",
              "layers": 1, "groupAll": false, "ignoreAir": false, "ignoreLiquids": false, "excavate": true, "speed": 2.0,
              "placeIntervalTicks": 4, "reach": 4.5, "moveTimeoutSeconds": 10, "holdBlock": true, "silent": false, "materials": "donate",
              "scaffolding": true},
  "state": "waiting",
  "reason": "needs 12 minecraft:oak_planks (have 0, the rest of the build needs 140)",
  "cursor": 1834,
  "steps": 5120,
  "counters": {"placed": 1702, "skipped": 120, "denied": 12, "noItem": 0, "refused": 0, "restored": 0, "kept": 0},
  "materials": {"minecraft:glass": 4},
  "startedBy": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000000a1",
  "startedAt": "2026-11-04T18:20:11Z",
  "undo": {"entries": 1702, "capacity": 250000, "full": false, "remaining": -1}
}
```

While scaffolding stands, the record also lists it under `scaffolding`, so it can be removed after a crash. After a restart the server reads the schematic again and continues from the saved step; blocks already in place are skipped. If the schematic file changed or went missing, the build stops with that reason and can still be undone. `state` is one of `running`, `paused`, `waiting`, `finished`, `cancelled`, `undoing`, `undone` or `failed`.

## Settings

Plugin-wide limits live in `config.toml` and apply when the file is saved. Turning builds off stops every crew where it stands and saves progress; open builds continue once builds are turned on again. A lower `maximumBuilds` or `maximumTeam` lets running builds finish and only refuses new ones. File and schematic limits apply to the next read.

```toml
[builds]
enabled = true
maximumBuilds = 16         # builds that may run at once
maximumTeam = 8            # NPCs on one build
placementsPerTick = 32     # blocks placed per tick across every build
checksPerTick = 512        # blocks compared per tick across every build
undoPerTick = 32           # blocks restored per tick across every build
maximumVolume = 1000000    # cells in one schematic box
maximumPalette = 4096      # block states in one schematic
maximumSide = 1024         # blocks on each side of the box
maximumFileBytes = 33554432
maximumUndoEntries = 250000
saveSeconds = 5
```

## Platforms

| Platform | Builds | Protection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spigot and Paper | Yes, on the main thread | WorldGuard flags when installed, otherwise none |
| Fabric, NeoForge, Forge | Yes, on the server thread | None: mod servers have no standard protection API |
| Folia | No. `/animus build` and `animus:build` say so | |

On Folia a build site, the NPCs of its team and its material container can belong to different regions, so building is turned off there.

## Limits

- The NPC walks with the normal navigator, at most 30 blocks per walking leg, and climbs scaffolding for high blocks. A block it still cannot reach, with no room for scaffolding, is placed after `timeout` by moving the NPC next to it.
- Block entity contents (chest items, sign text, banner patterns) and schematic entities are not copied.
- Dug-out blocks are not returned as items.
- Builder `.schematic` files must be saved again as `.schem`.
