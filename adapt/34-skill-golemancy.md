Golemancy gains XP from building golems, watching golems kill hostile mobs, repairing iron golems, and tending copper golems.

## Earning XP

- Building a snow, copper, or iron golem pays `buildSnowXp`, `buildCopperXp`, or `buildIronXp` to the player who placed its carved pumpkin or jack o'lantern, and counts toward `golemancy.built`. The golem must appear within `buildAttributionWindowMillis` milliseconds and `buildAttributionRadius` blocks of that placement. Each golem type has its own `buildXpCooldownMillis` cooldown per player; builds during the cooldown still count toward the stat. Heads placed by dispensers pay nothing.
- When an iron golem or snow golem kills a hostile mob, every player within `witnessRadius` blocks of the golem who can use Golemancy earns `witnessXpMultiplier` times the kill value. The kill value is `golemKillXpBase` plus the victim's maximum health times `golemKillMaxHealthMultiplier`. One golem pays each player at most once per `witnessCooldownMillis`, and each player earns at most `witnessHourlyCap` witness XP in any 60 minutes. Mobs from spawners and trial spawners pay `spawnerMobXpMultiplier` times the normal amount. Adapt minions, such as TragOul skeletal servants and Stealth shadow decoys, and Excavation grave mobs pay nothing.
- Repairing a player-built iron golem with an iron ingot pays `repairXpPerHealth` per point of health restored. Only health that hostile mobs took away counts; damage from players is never paid back as XP.
- Scraping an oxidation stage off a copper golem with an axe pays `copperScrapeXp`. Waxing a copper golem with honeycomb pays `copperWaxXp`, once per golem.

## Adaptations

Golemancy's adaptations unlock golem binding, nodes, and runes.

### Animus Binding (`golem-animus-binding`)

5 levels · 2 knowledge, then 4 per level

Binds a golem to you as a companion and unlocks the Artificer's Crook and Blank Animus Core recipes at level 1.

Hold an Animus Core in your main hand, sneak, and right-click a golem. The golem freezes and shrinks toward its bound size while the ritual runs. Moving more than 4 blocks from the golem, switching your held item, or the golem taking damage breaks the ritual, and the golem returns to its normal size. When the ritual finishes, the core and the tithe levels are used up, the golem becomes "*Owner*'s *Body* Golem", and it starts following you. Creative players pay no levels.

A binding needs all of the following:

- The golem is not bound already.
- A player built the golem. Iron golems that no player built, such as village iron golems, bind only when `allowBindingVillageGolems` is on.
- For `builderExclusiveSeconds` after a golem is built, only the player who built it can bind it.
- Frost golems bind with this adaptation alone. Copper golems also need Copper Frame and iron golems Iron Frame.
- The core is allowed for that body by `allowedCoresFrost`, `allowedCoresCopper`, or `allowedCoresIron` in the skill configuration. A Blank Animus Core binds a Companion; a role core also needs that role's Core adaptation.
- You own fewer golems than your level allows. `hardCapPerPlayer` caps every level.
- The chunk holds fewer than `maxBoundGolemsPerChunk` bound golems.
- Region protection lets you interact with the golem.
- You have the tithe levels for that body.

| Level | Golem cap | Ritual | Bind tithe (frost / copper / iron) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 4.0 s | 1 / 2 / 3 levels |
| 2 | 2 | 3.5 s | 1 / 2 / 3 levels |
| 3 | 3 | 3.0 s | 1 / 1 / 2 levels |
| 4 | 5 | 2.5 s | 1 / 1 / 2 levels |
| 5 | 7 | 2.0 s | 0 / 1 / 1 levels |

A Companion golem, bound with a Blank Animus Core, follows you by default. Its Golem GUI cycles Follow, Stay, and Home. It attacks mobs within 12 blocks that target you or it: snow golems throw snowballs and iron golems fight in melee. Copper golems never fight.

| Recipe | Pattern | Keys | Yield | Tithe |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Artificer's Crook | ` A ` / `RHR` / ` C ` | H `IRON_HOE`, A `AMETHYST_SHARD`, R `REDSTONE`, C `COPPER_INGOT` | 1 | 0 |
| Blank Animus Core | `ARA` / `RPR` / `ARA` | A `AMETHYST_SHARD`, R `REDSTONE`, P `ENDER_PEARL` | 1 | 1 level |

Each recipe is a table with `rows` (1 to 3 rows of up to 3 symbols, a space for an empty slot), `keys` (a material name, an item tag such as `#planks`, or a Golemancy item such as `golemancy:blank_core`), `result`, `amount` (1 to 64), `tithe` (experience levels charged per craft), and `enabled`. Players without the tithe levels see no result, shift-crafting stops at the crafts their levels cover, creative players craft free, and crafter blocks never craft a recipe with a tithe. Recipe changes apply after a restart.

| Key | Code default | Behavior / units |
|-----|--------------|------------------|
| `golemCapByLevel` | `[1, 2, 3, 5, 7]` | Most golems you can own at once, from level 1 upward. `hardCapPerPlayer` still caps every level. |
| `ritualSecondsByLevel` | `[4.0, 3.5, 3.0, 2.5, 2.0]` | Seconds the binding ritual takes, from level 1 upward. |
| `titheSnowByLevel` | `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]` | Experience levels to bind a frost golem, from level 1 upward. |
| `titheCopperByLevel` | `[2, 2, 1, 1, 1]` | Experience levels to bind a copper golem, from level 1 upward. |
| `titheIronByLevel` | `[3, 3, 2, 2, 1]` | Experience levels to bind an iron golem, from level 1 upward. |
| `builderExclusiveSeconds` | `300` | Seconds after a golem is built during which only its builder can bind it. 0 lets anyone bind it at once. |
| `allowBindingVillageGolems` | `false` | Lets players bind iron golems that no player built. |
| `crookRecipe` | ` A ` / `RHR` / ` C `, tithe 0 | Artificer's Crook recipe. |
| `blankCoreRecipe` | `ARA` / `RPR` / `ARA`, tithe 1 | Blank Animus Core recipe. |
