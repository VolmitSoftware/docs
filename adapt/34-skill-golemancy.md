Golemancy gains XP from building golems, watching golems kill hostile mobs, repairing iron golems, and tending copper golems.

## Earning XP

- Building a snow, copper, or iron golem pays `buildSnowXp`, `buildCopperXp`, or `buildIronXp` to the player who placed its carved pumpkin or jack o'lantern, and counts toward `golemancy.built`. The golem must appear within `buildAttributionWindowMillis` milliseconds and `buildAttributionRadius` blocks of that placement. Each golem type has its own `buildXpCooldownMillis` cooldown per player; builds during the cooldown still count toward the stat. Heads placed by dispensers pay nothing.
- When an iron golem or snow golem kills a hostile mob, every player within `witnessRadius` blocks of the golem who can use Golemancy earns `witnessXpMultiplier` times the kill value. The kill value is `golemKillXpBase` plus the victim's maximum health times `golemKillMaxHealthMultiplier`. One golem pays each player at most once per `witnessCooldownMillis`, and each player earns at most `witnessHourlyCap` witness XP in any 60 minutes. Mobs from spawners and trial spawners pay `spawnerMobXpMultiplier` times the normal amount. Adapt minions, such as TragOul skeletal servants and Stealth shadow decoys, and Excavation grave mobs pay nothing.
- Repairing a player-built iron golem with an iron ingot pays `repairXpPerHealth` per point of health restored. Only health that hostile mobs took away counts; damage from players is never paid back as XP.
- Scraping an oxidation stage off a copper golem with an axe pays `copperScrapeXp`. Waxing a copper golem with honeycomb pays `copperWaxXp`, once per golem.

## Adaptations

Golemancy's adaptations unlock golem binding, nodes, and runes.
