Configuration lives in `plugins/BileTools/biletools.yml`. The table below lists the defaults written on first run. BileTools rewrites supported values after loading and restores missing keys.

## Runtime

| Key | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `language` | `en_US` | Selects the bundled locale used for player and operator text. `language.yml` contains sparse overrides only |
| `metrics` | `true` | Starts anonymous bStats reporting during enable. Requires a restart to change |

## Watcher

Controls automatic hot-reload.

| Key | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `watcher.idle-poll-ticks` | `20` | Coordinator check interval when no watcher, staging, deletion, or reload work is pending. Minimum `1` |
| `watcher.active-poll-ticks` | `5` | Coordinator check interval while watcher, staging, deletion, or reload work is pending. Minimum `1` |
| `watcher.fingerprint-debounce-ticks` | `8` | Consecutive stable file-stamp checks required before staging a jar. Minimum `1` |
| `watcher.ignore` | see below | Plugin names the watcher will never auto-manage |
| `watcher.only` | `[]` | If non-empty, switches to allowlist mode — **only** these are auto-managed |
{.dense}

Default `watcher.ignore`:

```yaml
watcher:
  ignore:
    - LuckPerms
    - Vault
    - ProtocolLib
    - packetevents
    - WorldGuard
    - CoreProtect
    - spark
```

These plugins are excluded by default. Hot-reload is often dangerous or
pointless for them. They hold static state. They register protocol hooks. Other
plugins depend on them.

Automatic reload waits for a jar to finish changing. Temporary upload files are ignored. Changes made during a reload apply in the next batch.

Manual `/bile load`, `/bile unload`, and `/bile reload` operations bypass the
automatic filter and cadence.

## Lifecycle and observability

| Key | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `lifecycle.health-check` | `true` | Fail the reload if the plugin is not actually enabled and registered afterwards |
| `observability.log-timings` | `true` | Log unload, load and reload phase timings |
| `archive-plugins` | `true` | Archive a copy of a jar before `uninstall` deletes it |

Leave `health-check` on. If you turn it off, a plugin that throws during
`onEnable` reports a successful reload. The plugin stays inert.

`observability.log-timings` controls reload timing summaries.

## Remote deploy

| Key | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `remote-deploy.slave.slave-enabled` | `false` | Listen for incoming jar deployments |
| `remote-deploy.slave.slave-port` | `9876` | Listener port |
| `remote-deploy.slave.slave-payload` | `pickapassword` | Shared secret the master must present |
| `remote-deploy.master.master-enabled` | `false` | Push jars to configured targets |
| `remote-deploy.master.master-deploy-to` | `["yourserver.com:9876:password"]` | Targets as `host:port:password` |
| `remote-deploy.master.master-deploy-signatures` | `["MyPlugin", "AnotherPlugin"]` | Which plugins get pushed |
| `remote-deploy.socket-timeout-ms` | `15000` | Socket timeout. Minimum `1000` |
| `remote-deploy.max-transfer-bytes` | `268435456` | 256 MiB cap per transfer. Minimum 1 MiB |
{.dense}

The master and the slave both default to off. Read
[Remote Deploy](/biletools/remote-deploy) before you enable either half.
