Installed on a Minecraft client, the Iris mod adds a native pregeneration HUD, a full-screen Vision map, a What overlay for the block under your cursor, Studio toasts, and Iris world types in singleplayer. It talks to Iris servers over one channel, `irisworldgen:main`, which works identically whether the server is a mod loader or a Bukkit-family plugin. Vanilla clients never see the channel and fall back to server-side progress reporting. See also [07 - Pregeneration](/iris/07-pregeneration), [08 - Localization](/iris/08-localization), [10 - Studio & VSCode Schemas](/iris/10-studio-vscode-schemas), and [30 - Platform Differences](/iris/30-platform-differences).

## Get the HUD working

There is no separate client download. The Fabric, Forge, and NeoForge mod jars each contain the client code, gated to the client distribution, so the same jar you run on a server is the one you install on a client. The Iris and Minecraft versions on both ends must match — a mismatch is the single most common reason the HUD never appears.

1. Install the Iris mod on your client and join an Iris server.
2. Start a small pregen from the server, for example `/iris pregen start radius=512 center=0,0 gui=false`.
3. Look at the top-left of your screen.

Success is a dark panel at 6,6 with a green title, a `done / total (percent%)` line, a green progress bar, and a rate-and-ETA line under it. If region deltas are arriving you also get a small region grid below the panel.

Then check the other two surfaces:

4. Press `M`. The Vision map should open full-screen. Drag to pan, scroll to zoom, Esc to close.
5. Press `J` to toggle the What overlay, then look at a block. It should list the biome, the region, the cave biome if there is one, and the height.
6. Walk into a non-Iris world. Vision and What stop reporting Iris data; the client clears its cached tiles and markers when the server tells it the dimension changed.
7. Disconnect and reconnect, then repeat step 3. This proves the handshake actually reruns rather than the UI showing stale state.

If the panel never appears, work through this order: confirm the versions match on both sides, reconnect to force a fresh handshake, then read the server log. A protocol version mismatch and a rejected frame both leave a trace there.

One thing that is not evidence: a working boss bar on a modded server proves the pregen job is running and that the server can talk to your client's *vanilla* surface. It does not prove the Iris payload path works. In fact the boss bar appearing at all means the payload path did **not** come up for you — see below.

## What each combination gives you

| Server | Vanilla client | Client with the Iris mod |
|---|---|---|
| Modded Iris (Fabric/Forge/NeoForge) | Boss bar for whoever started the pregen | Native HUD, Vision, What, and toasts over custom payloads. No boss bar |
| Bukkit-family Iris | Console output and `/iris pregen status`. No boss bar, no Iris client features | The same native HUD, Vision, What, and toasts, carried over plugin messaging on the same channel |
| Non-Iris server | Nothing | The mod goes inert once the handshake times out |

In singleplayer, installed packs register world generator presets under the `irisworldgen` namespace and appear as selectable World Types in the create-world screen. The integrated server runs the same engine as a dedicated one.

## Keybinds

Category **Iris** (`key.categories.irisworldgen.iris`). All three are rebindable in Controls.

| Action | Default | Translation key |
|---|---|---|
| Toggle pregen HUD | `H` | `key.irisworldgen.toggle_pregen_hud` |
| Open Iris Vision map | `M` | `key.irisworldgen.open_vision_map` |
| Toggle Iris What overlay | `J` | `key.irisworldgen.toggle_what_overlay` |

The HUD starts visible; the What overlay starts hidden. Both toggles are pure client state and are not remembered across restarts.

Pressing F1 hides the whole layered HUD, so the pregen panel and What overlay disappear. Toasts are pumped from a separate per-tick hook precisely so they still advance and expire while the GUI is hidden, instead of piling up until you press F1 again.

## Pregen HUD

The panel draws at 6,6 whenever a tracked job exists and has not expired.

| Element | Content |
|---|---|
| Title | The localized pregen header |
| Stats | `done / total (percent%)`, thousands-separated, percent to one decimal |
| Bar | Green while running, amber while paused, gray once stale |
| Tail | Rate and ETA while running, `PAUSED` while paused, or "no updates for N s" once stale |
| Region grid | Only when region deltas have arrived. Each cell is a region: gray pending, amber generating, green done |

Two client-side timers, both measured from the last progress frame received:

| Threshold | Value | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Stale | 5 s | Every color mutes to gray and the tail switches to the stale label |
| Expire | 30 s | The panel stops drawing entirely |

Because both timers key off frame arrival, a stale panel means the frames stopped, not that the job stopped. A paused job keeps sending progress frames and stays amber rather than going gray. A `PregenEnd` frame clears the job and the region grid immediately, with no wait for either timer.

## Boss bar fallback

On modded servers, `ModdedPregenBossBar` shows a boss bar to the player who started the pregen — green while running, yellow while paused, updated every 10 ticks, titled from `iris.runtime.pregen.bossbar.running` / `.paused`.

It is suppressed if that player already has a ready protocol session with `CAPABILITY_PREGEN`. That is the deliberate rule: you get the boss bar **or** the native HUD, never both. So if you installed the client mod and still see a boss bar, the handshake did not complete.

Bukkit-family servers have no equivalent boss bar. Players without the mod get `/iris pregen status`, the console, and the desktop pregen window; players with the mod get the same native HUD as on modded, delivered over plugin messaging.

## Vision map and What overlay

| Feature | Requires | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Vision map (`M`) | Ready session, an Iris dimension, and `CAPABILITY_VISION` from the server | Full-screen. Drag to pan, scroll to zoom, Esc to close |
| What overlay (`J`) | Ready session, an Iris dimension, and `CAPABILITY_CURSOR` | Reports biome, region, cave biome when present, and height for the cursor column |
| Studio toasts | The client advertises `CAPABILITY_STUDIO` | Hotload and toast frames render when the server sends them |
| Dimension status | Only a completed handshake | Carries pack key, dimension key, seed, and height bounds. A world that is not Iris-generated clears the client's tiles and markers |

Zoom level is part of the tile cache key, so changing zoom invalidates every cached tile and the map repaints progressively as new tiles arrive under the 8-per-second request budget. That is expected behavior, not a stall.

Vision tiles are split across frames: 24000 bytes of payload per chunk after a 25-byte header. One markers frame carries at most 256 markers.

## Protocol

| Constant | Value |
|---|---|
| Channel | `irisworldgen:main` |
| Protocol version | `1` |
| Transport (modded) | Custom payloads on the play channel |
| Transport (Bukkit) | Incoming and outgoing plugin messaging on the same channel name |
| Max frame | 24576 bytes |
| Max inbound frames per client per second | 32 |
| Max vision tile requests per second | 8 |
| Max cursor lookups per second | 4 |
| Max queryable block coordinate | ±29,999,999 |

Cursor lookups get their own budget rather than a slice of the frame budget because each one costs three engine column queries; a client that spent its whole frame allowance on them would be 32 column resolves per second per player.

Message types (`IrisProtocol.TYPE_*`):

| Id | Direction | Message | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | C→S | `ClientHello` | Opens the session; carries the client's protocol version and capability mask |
| 2 | S→C | `ServerHello` | Answers with the server's version, granted capabilities, brand string, and whether Iris is active |
| 3 | S→C | `PregenProgress` | Chunks done, chunks total, rate, ETA, and run state for one job |
| 4 | S→C | `PregenEnd` | Job finished or cancelled; clears the HUD and region grid |
| 5 | S→C | `DimensionStatus` | Pack, dimension, seed, and height bounds for the world the player is in, or a flag saying it is not Iris |
| 6 | C→S | `CursorInfoRequest` | Asks about one X/Z column, for the What overlay |
| 7 | S→C | `CursorInfo` | Biome, region, cave biome, and height for that column |
| 8 | C→S | `VisionTileRequest` | Asks for one map tile at a zoom level |
| 9 | S→C | `VisionTile` | Tile image data, split into chunks when it exceeds one frame |
| 10 | S→C | `VisionMarkers` | Labelled points overlaid on one map tile; each carries a block position, an icon kind, and a label |
| 11 | S→C | `PregenRegionDelta` | Per-region state changes that drive the HUD's region grid |
| 12 | S→C | `StudioHotload` | Pack reloaded: which files changed and whether it failed |
| 13 | S→C | `Toast` | A one-off notification with a kind, title, and body |

Capability bits:

| Bit | Name | Gates |
|---|---|---|
| `1 << 0` | `CAPABILITY_PREGEN` | Progress frames, end frames, and region deltas |
| `1 << 1` | `CAPABILITY_VISION` | Vision tile requests and marker frames |
| `1 << 2` | `CAPABILITY_CURSOR` | Cursor column lookups |
| `1 << 3` | `CAPABILITY_STUDIO` | Studio hotload notifications |

The client advertises all four. Bukkit and modded servers both grant all four. Negotiation is effectively an intersection, but it is enforced from both sides rather than stored as one mask: the server checks the client's advertised bits before serving a request, and the client checks the server's granted bits before offering a feature.

## Handshake

1. On joining a world the client clears its world-local state and sends `ClientHello` with protocol version `1` and its capability mask.
2. It retries every 2 s, up to 5 attempts. After that the session goes `UNSUPPORTED` and the mod stays quiet — this is what happens on a non-Iris server.
3. If the versions differ, the server still replies with a `ServerHello` naming its version so the client can land in `INCOMPATIBLE` and report the mismatch, rather than timing out and claiming the server does not run Iris. The session stays un-ready, and every subsequent frame from that client is dropped.
4. On a version match the session becomes `READY`, and dimension status and feature frames follow.
5. On disconnect the session resets and all world-local state — pregen job, tiles, markers, cursor, toasts, region grid — is cleared.

Session states are `IDLE`, `AWAITING_HELLO`, `READY`, `UNSUPPORTED`, and `INCOMPATIBLE`.

Server-side, frames arriving before a successful hello are counted and dropped, frames over the per-second budget are counted and dropped, oversized or malformed frames are rejected by the decoder, and a cursor query outside ±29,999,999 is rejected rather than clamped so a spoofed frame is recorded instead of served. Every one of these keeps a counter, which is why an unexplained absence of client features is worth checking against the server log before you suspect the client.

## Localization

The server's `general.language` drives the boss bar and every shared UI string, including the HUD stats and What overlay rows, which resolve through `ClientUiMessages` on whichever process renders them. Only the three keybind labels and their category come from the client jar's `assets/irisworldgen/lang/*.json`. See [08 - Localization](/iris/08-localization).

## Operator verification checklist

- Modded server plus Iris client: progress on the native HUD, and **no** boss bar for that player
- Bukkit Iris plus Iris client: the same HUD, over plugin messaging
- Vanilla client on either server: no protocol traffic, and on modded the boss bar as described
- Non-Iris server plus Iris client: silent after roughly 10 s of hello retries
- `H` toggles the HUD, `M` opens Vision where the capability is granted, `J` toggles What where the capability is granted
