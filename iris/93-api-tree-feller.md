`art.arcane.iris.api.tree` lets another plugin **drive** the Iris tree feller and **charge** for it. The feller removes a whole Iris-generated tree when a sneaking survival player breaks one of its logs with an axe. Integrations can start a run Iris would not start, override durability rules, and reserve a cost per log with commit or refund. The feature is **off by default** (`treeFeller.enabled = false`); the standalone path also requires `iris.treefeller`. `INTEGRATION_OVERRIDE` bypasses both the enabled switch and the permission.

Build and service acquisition: [API - Getting Started](/iris/90-api-getting-started). Service: `IrisTreeFellerService` at `ServicePriority.Normal`.

| Goal | Use |
|---|---|
| Start a felling run Iris would not start, or price it | `tryFell` with `TreeFellerOptions.integrationOverride(...)` |
| Avoid double-handling Iris-generated breaks during a run | `isManagedBreak` |
| Ask whether a block belongs to an Iris tree | `isTreeBlock` |

```java
package com.example.woodcutting;

import art.arcane.iris.api.tree.IrisTreeFellerService;
import org.bukkit.Bukkit;
import org.bukkit.plugin.RegisteredServiceProvider;

public final class FellerAccess {
    private FellerAccess() {
    }

    public static IrisTreeFellerService service() {
        RegisteredServiceProvider<IrisTreeFellerService> provider =
                Bukkit.getServicesManager().getRegistration(IrisTreeFellerService.class);
        return provider == null ? null : provider.getProvider();
    }
}
```

```java
public interface IrisTreeFellerService {
    boolean tryFell(BlockBreakEvent event, TreeFellerOptions options);

    boolean isManagedBreak(BlockBreakEvent event);

    boolean isTreeBlock(Block block);
}
```

## Lifecycle

```
your BlockBreakEvent handler
   |
   v
tryFell(event, options)         register a felling request against this break.
   |                            true = YOUR access is pending (first writer or same-access re-call).
   |                            Nothing removed yet; no hook fired.
   |
   |  (Iris re-checks at EventPriority.MONITOR)
   v
onActivationAccepted()          run is real. At most once, if at all.
   |
   |  (per LOG block, discovery order)
   v
reserveLogCost()   -> false     refuse; run ends; nothing reserved to refund.
   |
   | true
   v
   +--> commitLogCost()         log gone; charge final
   +--> refundLogCost()         log not removed; give cost back
```

Guarantees:

- `onActivationAccepted` fires **at most once per run**, only after MONITOR re-validation: event not cancelled, block still the same Iris tree, tree not already claimed.
- `reserveLogCost` once per **log** (not leaves). Leaves never reserve.
- Reserve runs **before** axe durability charge.
- Exactly one of `commitLogCost` or `refundLogCost` follows a true reserve, except the miss cases under Failure policy.
- **`commitLogCost` is final.** No later refund for that log.
- `reserveLogCost` false ends the **whole** run immediately.
- One tree, one run, server-wide. A second player on the same tree gets the break cancelled with drops suppressed; no hooks for them.
- **No terminal callback.** Count commits/refunds against activation if you need end-of-run accounting.

## Threading

| Call | Thread |
|---|---|
| `tryFell` | Thread delivering `BlockBreakEvent` (region thread owning the block) |
| `isManagedBreak` | Any thread (set lookup) |
| `isTreeBlock` | Region thread owning the block; can block on disk |
| `onActivationAccepted` | Region thread of the broken block, inline in MONITOR |
| `reserveLogCost` | Player entity path: entity scheduler on Folia; may run inline on Paper main when already primary |
| `commitLogCost` | Same entity path (scheduled onto the player when not already inline) |
| `refundLogCost` | Same entity path when a refund is delivered |

Cost hooks may touch the feller's inventory/XP/effects. Do **not** read/write blocks from cost hooks on Folia (entity thread ≠ region).

`onActivationAccepted` is inside event dispatch — return promptly.

**Do not block any of the four hooks.** No I/O, no `join`, no long locks. Iris does not time out hanging hooks. Cache remote data (e.g. on join).

### `isTreeBlock` is expensive

Reads Iris mantle for tree provenance. Cold mantle regions load from disk **synchronously on your thread**. Also reads block type/data — chunk must be loaded; call from the owning region thread.

Do not call per block in a loop, per tick, or over large areas. Use for blocks a player just interacted with.

## Worked example: stamina per log

### Hooks

```java
package com.example.woodcutting;

import art.arcane.iris.api.tree.TreeFellerRunHooks;

import java.util.UUID;

public final class StaminaFellHooks implements TreeFellerRunHooks {
    private static final int COST_PER_LOG = 4;

    private final StaminaPool pool;
    private final UUID fellerId;

    public StaminaFellHooks(StaminaPool pool, UUID fellerId) {
        this.pool = pool;
        this.fellerId = fellerId;
    }

    @Override
    public void onActivationAccepted() {
        pool.beginRun(fellerId);
    }

    @Override
    public boolean reserveLogCost() {
        return pool.withdraw(fellerId, COST_PER_LOG);
    }

    @Override
    public void commitLogCost() {
        pool.recordSpend(fellerId, COST_PER_LOG);
    }

    @Override
    public void refundLogCost() {
        pool.deposit(fellerId, COST_PER_LOG);
    }
}
```

All four methods are required (no defaults). `TreeFellerRunHooks.NONE` is the shared no-op with `reserveLogCost` always true.

Hooks are **per run**, not per plugin. Build a new instance per `tryFell` and store feller identity in it. Iris holds the reference for the run and never inspects it beyond the four methods.

### Listener

```java
package com.example.woodcutting;

import art.arcane.iris.api.tree.IrisTreeFellerService;
import art.arcane.iris.api.tree.TreeFellerOptions;
import org.bukkit.entity.Player;
import org.bukkit.event.EventHandler;
import org.bukkit.event.EventPriority;
import org.bukkit.event.Listener;
import org.bukkit.event.block.BlockBreakEvent;

public final class WoodcuttingListener implements Listener {
    private static final int PRESERVE_PERCENT = 50;

    private final StaminaPool pool;

    public WoodcuttingListener(StaminaPool pool) {
        this.pool = pool;
    }

    @EventHandler(priority = EventPriority.HIGH, ignoreCancelled = true)
    public void onBreak(BlockBreakEvent event) {
        IrisTreeFellerService feller = FellerAccess.service();

        if (feller == null || feller.isManagedBreak(event)) {
            return;
        }

        Player player = event.getPlayer();

        if (!pool.hasWoodcutting(player.getUniqueId())) {
            return;
        }

        TreeFellerOptions options = TreeFellerOptions.integrationOverride(
                PRESERVE_PERCENT, new StaminaFellHooks(pool, player.getUniqueId()));

        feller.tryFell(event, options);
    }
}
```

`isManagedBreak` is required: Iris fires a `BlockBreakEvent` for every block it removes during a run so protection plugins see removals. Without the guard you re-enter `tryFell` on every member.

`EventPriority.HIGH` is the usual choice: after typical protection cancels, before Iris's own standalone request at `HIGHEST`. See pending rules below.

```java
@Override
public void onEnable() {
    getServer().getPluginManager().registerEvents(new WoodcuttingListener(pool), this);
}
```

---

## Minimum: override only, no charge

```java
IrisTreeFellerService feller = FellerAccess.service();

if (feller != null && !feller.isManagedBreak(event) && classes.isWoodcutter(event.getPlayer())) {
    feller.tryFell(event, TreeFellerOptions.integrationOverride(0, TreeFellerRunHooks.NONE));
}
```

`durabilityPreservationChance` of `0` charges every log (vanilla-like). `100` never charges durability for logs. Unbreakable axes are never charged.

`TreeFellerOptions.standalone()` is Iris's own request shape; third parties almost never need it. It still requires `treeFeller.enabled` and `iris.treefeller`.

---

## What `tryFell` promises

```java
boolean tryFell(BlockBreakEvent event, TreeFellerOptions options);
```

`true` means a pending request is associated with this break for your call path — **not** that a tree will fall. Iris re-validates at `MONITOR` and may drop the request with no hooks.

### Pending request precedence

Pending state is keyed by the `BlockBreakEvent` instance.

| Existing pending | New request | Result |
|---|---|---|
| none | any | Accept; store request; return `true` |
| `STANDALONE` | `STANDALONE` | Keep existing; return `true` |
| `STANDALONE` | `INTEGRATION_OVERRIDE` | Replace the pending standalone request; return `true` |
| `INTEGRATION_OVERRIDE` | `INTEGRATION_OVERRIDE` | Keep the first override; return `true` |
| `INTEGRATION_OVERRIDE` | `STANDALONE` | Keep the override; return `false` |
| managed internal probe (no pending, already managed) | any | return `false` |

`INTEGRATION_OVERRIDE` has precedence over Iris's pending standalone request. The first accepted override keeps its hooks and options; later overrides are idempotently accepted without replacing it. Iris registers its standalone request at `EventPriority.HIGHEST` and finalizes at `MONITOR`, so integrations should submit overrides no later than `HIGHEST` and avoid `MONITOR` ordering races.

Open run state in `onActivationAccepted`, not at `tryFell`.

`false` when:

- service disabled, or `event`/`options` null;
- event already cancelled;
- managed break with no pending (Iris probe / already finalizing path);
- `canUse` failed — standalone needs enabled + permission; override never fails this;
- break is not a fellable candidate;
- candidate resolve throws (logged).

### Candidate checks (no bypass)

`INTEGRATION_OVERRIDE` skips enabled switch and permission only. Still required:

- `GameMode.SURVIVAL`
- player sneaking
- broken block tagged `Tag.LOGS`
- main-hand item is an axe (`*_AXE` material name)
- Iris tree provenance in mantle: placed by an Iris tree, not replaced since, not structure-aware

Vanilla saplings and hand-placed logs never fell. Provenance clears when a block is broken or built over.

---

## How a run comes apart

Discovery walks mantle provenance outward from the broken block in 26 directions, BFS. Members remove in discovery order (trigger first; ties Y then X then Z).

Bounds — any hit marks discovery incomplete; Iris falls back to **only the trigger block**:

| Bound | Value |
|---|---|
| Members collected | 131 072 |
| Positions visited | 1 000 000 |
| Distance from trigger on any axis | 256 blocks |

Removal is paced in batches with tick yields. Batch size scales with tree size.

Run ends immediately (no further hooks) when the player:

- stops sneaking,
- changes held hotbar slot,
- swaps hands,
- goes offline, leaves survival, or changes world,
- breaks the axe (after that log's commit),
- or replaces the axe in that slot with a different item.

Each removed block fires a `BlockBreakEvent` with `isManagedBreak == true`. Cancelled **log** probes refund that log's reservation and end the run; cancelled **leaf** probes continue. Drops use the axe as it was before that block's durability charge (Silk Touch / Fortune apply). The original break is cancelled with drops and XP suppressed; Iris delivers per block.

---

## Options

```java
public record TreeFellerOptions(
        TreeFellerAccess access,
        int durabilityPreservationChance,
        TreeFellerRunHooks runHooks) {

    public static TreeFellerOptions standalone();

    public static TreeFellerOptions integrationOverride(
            int durabilityPreservationChance,
            TreeFellerRunHooks runHooks);
}
```

Canonical constructor: null `access`/`runHooks` → `NullPointerException`; chance outside `0..100` → `IllegalArgumentException`.

`durabilityPreservationChance` is percent chance a log costs **no** durability. Rolled per log.

**Honoured only for `INTEGRATION_OVERRIDE`.** Standalone uses `treeFeller.durabilityPreservationChance` from settings; `standalone()` hard-codes `0` in the record for that reason.

```java
public interface TreeFellerRunHooks {
    TreeFellerRunHooks NONE;

    void onActivationAccepted();

    boolean reserveLogCost();

    void commitLogCost();

    void refundLogCost();
}
```

Iris never calls `equals`/`hashCode`/`toString` on hooks.

---

## Failure policy

| Misbehaviour | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `onActivationAccepted` throws | Logged; **run continues** (notification, not veto) |
| `reserveLogCost` throws | Logged as false; run ends; nothing refunded |
| `reserveLogCost` returns false | Run ends cleanly |
| `commitLogCost` throws | Logged; run ends; **block already gone** |
| `refundLogCost` throws | Logged; run ends |
| Hook blocks a long time | Nothing — no timeout |
| null event or options | `tryFell` → false |
| Two overrides for one break | First stored override's hooks stay; later override returns true without replacing |
| Candidate resolve throws | Logged; false |
| `isTreeBlock` throws | Logged; false |
| Iris disabled mid-run | Active runs finish immediately; **no refund for outstanding reserves** |

No integration quarantine.

### Missed refund

Refunds schedule onto the feller's entity path. If scheduling fails (logout/removal) or shutdown ends runs, **`refundLogCost` may not run**. Exposure is at most one log cost per run in the reserve→resolve window. For strict accounting, accumulate in your own state and reconcile on quit/`onDisable`.

## Configuration

`plugins/Iris/settings.json`:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `treeFeller.enabled` | `false` | Standalone path only. Override ignores it |
| `treeFeller.durabilityPreservationChance` | `0` | Standalone durability preserve %; clamped `0..100` on read |

| Permission | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `iris.treefeller` | `op` | Standalone only. Override does not check it |

Related operator surface: [Integrations](/iris/28-integrations), [Commands & Permissions](/iris/04-commands-permissions).

## Enum reference

### `TreeFellerAccess`

| Constant | Enabled switch | `iris.treefeller` | Durability chance source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `STANDALONE` | Required | Required | Settings; value in options ignored |
| `INTEGRATION_OVERRIDE` | Bypassed | Bypassed | Value in options |

Neither mode bypasses survival, sneak, axe, log tag, or mantle provenance.
