`tropical/mountain-plains` is a directly selected land biome in the pinned Overworld 4002 and Underworld 1005 packs. Overworld and Underworld use the same terrain with different materials, Minecraft biome identities, decorations, and ecology.

## Selection and weighting

The percentage is this biome's weighted share after Iris selects its region and the land role. Region distribution and selection noise still control world-scale coverage.

| Pack | Region | List occurrences | Rarity divisor | Combined raw weight | Effective land-list share |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Overworld 4002 | `tropical` (Tropical) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 8.33% |
| Underworld 1005 | `tropical` (Underworld Tropical) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 8.33% |

Each repeated entry contributes another `1 / rarity` weight.

## Shared terrain

Both packs use the same generator links: `mountain` (88..157); combined authored contribution `88..157` blocks relative to fluid height.

Biome identity scatter uses `SIMPLEX` noise in the Overworld configuration. Generator minima and maxima are contributions relative to each dimension fluid height; stacked links add together.

## Overworld 4002 treatment

- **Minecraft identity:** derivative `minecraft:jungle`; native-structure derivative `minecraft:jungle`; custom identities `tropical_mountain_plains`.
- **Surface:** 1 block(s) at slope 0-4.5: `minecraft:grass_block`; 2 block(s) at slope 0-4.5: `minecraft:dirt`. Wall palette: none.
- **Content:** 3 object placement rule(s) drawing from 18 object key(s), including `clutter/sbush1`, `clutter/sbush2`, `clutter/sbush3`, `trees/jungle/lgeneric1`, `trees/jungle/lgeneric2`, `trees/jungle/lgeneric3`, `trees/jungle/lgeneric4`, and 11 more. 4 decorator rule(s) using `minecraft:short_grass`, `minecraft:tall_grass`, `minecraft:dandelion`, `minecraft:poppy`, `minecraft:blue_orchid`, `minecraft:allium`, `minecraft:azure_bluet`, `minecraft:red_tulip`, `minecraft:orange_tulip`, and 6 more.

## Underworld 1005 treatment

- **Minecraft identity:** derivative `minecraft:basalt_deltas`; native-structure derivative `minecraft:basalt_deltas`; custom identities `underworld_tropical_mountain_plains_54f0e163`.
- **Surface:** 1 block(s) at slope 0-4.5: `minecraft:basalt`; 2 block(s) at slope 0-4.5: `minecraft:blackstone`. Wall palette: none.
- **Content:** 3 object placement rule(s) drawing from 18 object key(s), including `underworld/basalt/clutter/sbush1`, `underworld/basalt/clutter/sbush2`, `underworld/basalt/clutter/sbush3`, `underworld/basalt/trees/jungle/lgeneric1`, `underworld/basalt/trees/jungle/lgeneric2`, `underworld/basalt/trees/jungle/lgeneric3`, `underworld/basalt/trees/jungle/lgeneric4`, and 11 more. 5 decorator rule(s) (1 shared snippet reference(s)) using `minecraft:fire`, `minecraft:crimson_fungus`, `minecraft:nether_sprouts`, `minecraft:nether_wart_block`.
- **Entity spawners:** `nether/surface/basalt-deltas`, `nether/cave`.

Underworld keeps the terrain links but uses its Nether derivative, materials, objects, and surface/cave spawners.

## Children

No ordinary child biomes are declared.

## Floating variants

No floating child biomes are declared.

## Inspect in game

Run these in an Iris world and inspect freshly generated terrain:

```text
/iris find biome tropical/mountain-plains
/iris what biome
/iris what region
```

The first command locates the biome. The other commands confirm its load key and region at your position. Pack edits do not change existing chunks.
