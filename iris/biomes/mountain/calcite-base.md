`mountain/calcite-base` is a directly selected land biome in the pinned Overworld 4002 and Underworld 1005 packs. Overworld and Underworld use the same terrain with different materials, Minecraft biome identities, decorations, and ecology.

## Selection and weighting

The percentage is this biome's weighted share after Iris selects its region and the land role. Region distribution and selection noise still control world-scale coverage.

| Pack | Region | List occurrences | Rarity divisor | Combined raw weight | Effective land-list share |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Overworld 4002 | `tundra` (Tundra) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 6.12% |
| Underworld 1005 | `tundra` (Underworld Tundra) | 1 | 1 | 1 | 6.12% |

Each repeated entry contributes another `1 / rarity` weight.

## Shared terrain

Both packs use the same generator links: `mountain` (143..220); combined authored contribution `143..220` blocks relative to fluid height.

Biome identity scatter uses `SIMPLEX` noise in the Overworld configuration. Generator minima and maxima are contributions relative to each dimension fluid height; stacked links add together.

## Overworld 4002 treatment

- **Minecraft identity:** derivative `minecraft:windswept_hills`; native-structure derivative `minecraft:windswept_hills`; no custom or scatter identities.
- **Surface:** 2 block(s) at slope 0-3.6: `minecraft:grass_block`; 2 block(s) at slope 3.6-13.6: `minecraft:calcite`. Wall palette: `minecraft:stone`.
- **Content:** No biome-local object, decorator, procedural, deposit, or effect rules.

## Underworld 1005 treatment

- **Minecraft identity:** derivative `minecraft:basalt_deltas`; native-structure derivative `minecraft:basalt_deltas`; custom identities `underworld_mountain_calcite_base_2bae18be`.
- **Surface:** 2 block(s) at slope 0-3.6: `minecraft:basalt`; 2 block(s) at slope 3.6-13.6: `minecraft:blackstone`. Wall palette: `minecraft:blackstone`.
- **Content:** 1 decorator rule(s) (1 shared snippet reference(s)).
- **Entity spawners:** `nether/surface/basalt-deltas`, `nether/cave`.

Underworld keeps the terrain links but uses its Nether derivative, materials, objects, and surface/cave spawners.

## Children

No ordinary child biomes are declared.

## Floating variants

No floating child biomes are declared.

## Inspect in game

Run these in an Iris world and inspect freshly generated terrain:

```text
/iris find biome mountain/calcite-base
/iris what biome
/iris what region
```

The first command locates the biome. The other commands confirm its load key and region at your position. Pack edits do not change existing chunks.
