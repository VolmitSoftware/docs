GoldenHash is the cross-platform determinism gate. It regenerates a square
of chunks into memory buffers and hashes the blocks and biomes. It then
writes that fingerprint to a baseline file, or compares against one. The
same pack bytes, Iris seed, radius, center, and height range must produce
the same combined hash on Bukkit-family servers and on every mod loader.
The operator runbooks that use this gate are in
[31 - Operator Runbooks](/iris/31-operator-runbooks).

## What determinism means here

Iris generation is a pure function of the pack plus a seed. Feed the same
pack and the same seed to the engine and every block and biome must come
back identical. Same chunk, same platform, next week, other machine.
Nothing in that chain may depend on wall-clock time, hash iteration order,
thread scheduling, or which chunks happened to be generated first.

That property is what makes an Iris world portable. A player's base
survives a server restart. A Bukkit world can be reproduced on Fabric. A
pack author can hand someone a seed and get the same terrain back. When
determinism breaks, it usually breaks quietly. A handful of chunks differ
at a biome boundary or inside a cave. Nobody notices until a world is
regenerated months later and the terrain no longer lines up with the
buildings on it.

GoldenHash exists because looking at terrain cannot catch that. Two
screenshots can look identical while thousands of blocks differ. A hash
catches a single changed block state.

Generation fixes can intentionally change a baseline. Builds with
surface-fluid cave containment retain terrain at the wet cave boundary.
An older baseline may differ where a surface-breaking cave meets an ocean
or lake. Capture a replacement only after you confirm the mismatch is
limited to the expected generated-block change and remains identical
across repeated, threaded, and cross-platform runs.

Hydrology adds an accepted-plan determinism surface to this gate. For a fixed seed and pack fingerprint, the bounded terrain/policy lattice must produce the same outlets, acyclic drainage potential, independent surface and underground source sets, refined centerlines, non-rising heads, hydraulic segment types, profile/content choices, and exact column ownership regardless of which tile or chunk requests them first. Stable feature, course, segment, source, and outlet identities resolve ties. The immutable tile then supplies terrain, fluid, biomes, mantle cells, rendering, and locator results; those consumers must not reclassify it independently. A threaded or mantle-reset mismatch around a channel, drop, bore, grotto, mouth, deep-fluid body, or seal guard is a determinism defect.

## What GoldenHash actually does

1. Optionally deletes the world's mantle so nothing cached from an earlier
   run can leak into the comparison.
2. Walks a center-out spiral of chunks and calls `engine.generate` for each
   one into a scratch buffer. The world's region files are never touched.
3. SHA-256s every block state key in the chunk, and separately SHA-256s
   biome samples taken on a 4-block grid.
4. Sorts the per-chunk lines by chunk coordinate and SHA-256s the whole
   ordered body into one `#combined` value. Sorting is why thread count
   does not change the result.
5. Writes that as a baseline, or compares it to an existing one and
   reports MATCH or MISMATCH.

Because the scan regenerates rather than reading the world, it also proves
the engine can reproduce what it already wrote. It is not just that the
world file on disk is stable.

## Capture a baseline

Prerequisites: a disposable Iris world, frozen pack bytes, and a known
seed (`1337` is the convention across these docs). Use center chunk `0,0`
and a small radius such as `8` for a first run. Write down the Iris artifact
version, Minecraft version, pack hash, dimension height range, and JVM
before you start. A baseline without that provenance is not usable later.

1. On Bukkit, run the command twice. The Bukkit command is always `AUTO`.
   The first run captures because no file exists. The second verifies
   against it.

   ```text
   /iris developer goldenhash world=<world> radius=8 threads=1 center-x=0 center-z=0 reset-mantle=true deep=false
   /iris developer goldenhash world=<world> radius=8 threads=1 center-x=0 center-z=0 reset-mantle=true deep=false
   ```

   Expected: the first run prints a captured line with the chunk count, a
   12-character short hash, and the absolute path of the `.hashes` file.
   The second prints MATCH with the same short hash.

   If the first run prints nothing but an error about the world, the
   target is not a loaded Iris world with a live engine. Check
   `/iris worlds`.

2. On Fabric, Forge, or NeoForge, ask for the modes explicitly:

   ```text
   /iris goldenhash 8 1 capture
   /iris goldenhash 8 1 verify
   ```

   Expected: `capture` writes the file. `verify` reports MATCH. Progress
   lines appear per chunk while the total is 64 chunks or fewer, then
   every 32nd chunk above that.

3. Keep the `.hashes` file next to the exact artifact build and pack hash
   it came from. It is only meaningful with that provenance.

## Compare a second platform

1. Copy the `.hashes` file into the other platform's golden directory (see
   the table below). Do not rename it. The filename encodes the dimension
   key, seed, center, and radius the comparison depends on.
2. Create a disposable world there from the same pack bytes and the same
   seed, with the same dimension height range.
3. Run `verify` (modded) or the same `AUTO` command (Bukkit).
4. Expected: MATCH, and the same `#combined` value on every platform.
   Screenshots that look alike prove nothing.

Expect one warning on every cross-platform comparison. The `#mc` metadata
line differs because Bukkit records `Bukkit.getBukkitVersion()` (for
example `26.2-R0.1-SNAPSHOT`) while mod loaders record the plain Minecraft
version (`26.2`). That mismatch is a warning only and does not stop the
comparison. A seed or dimension mismatch is a hard failure and does stop
it.

## Prove the gate can fail

A gate nobody has seen fail is not a gate. Once, in a disposable copy:

1. Change one pack input or one engine input.
2. Re-run verify. Expected: MISMATCH, a `.new` file next to the golden
   file, and a `.diag-c<x>x<z>.txt` for the first differing chunk.
3. Restore the original input and confirm MATCH returns before you treat
   the baseline as a release artifact.

## Reading a result

| Result | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Captured | No baseline existed. One was written. The path is printed. |
| MATCH | Every chunk line is byte-identical to the baseline. The short combined hash is shown. |
| MISMATCH | At least one chunk differs. Up to 10 chunk keys are listed, then a count of the rest. `.new` and a diagnosis file are written. |
| Aborted | Some chunk failed to generate. Nothing is written. Fix the generation failure first. |
| Wrong world | The baseline's `#seed` or `#dim` does not match the live engine. No comparison is attempted. |

The diagnosis file regenerates the first mismatched chunk twice back to
back. It then regenerates a third time after deleting mantle chunks around
it, and labels what it found:

- **Repeat-generation STABLE** — two consecutive generations agree. The
  divergence depends on order or accumulated state, not on the generate
  call itself.
- **Repeat-generation UNSTABLE** — the same chunk differs between two
  consecutive calls with nothing in between. That is pure nondeterminism
  and is always an engine defect.
- **Mantle-reset** — compares the scan result against a generation with
  the surrounding mantle deleted. A difference here points at mantle
  carryover rather than the terrain math.

The file ends with a full non-air block dump of the first generation,
which is what you diff against the other platform's dump.

## When a check fails

| Symptom | What to do |
|---|---|
| Bukkit run says the target is not an Iris world | The world is not loaded or has no engine. Load it and retry. `AUTO` cannot capture from a dead engine. |
| `verify` says the baseline file is missing | The filename is built from dimension key, seed, center, and radius. One of those differs from the capture. Compare the name in the golden directory against your command. |
| Wrong world (seed or dimension) | Recreate the disposable world with the recorded seed and pack. Never hand-edit the metadata lines to force a comparison. |
| Mismatch only with multiple threads | Re-run both sides with `threads=1`. If serial matches and parallel does not, that is an engine defect, not a tuning problem. The result is sorted before hashing, so thread count must not matter. |
| Stable mismatch on both sides | Compare pack bytes, dimension height range, Iris artifact, and whether both runs reset mantle. Then read `.new` and the first `.diag-*` file. |
| Repeat-generation UNSTABLE | Stop the release comparison. Preserve the diagnosis artifacts. Consecutive generation is nondeterministic and no baseline is trustworthy until that is fixed. |

## Rules that keep comparisons honest

1. **Same pack bytes everywhere.** Same pack key, same files. For a
   release baseline, freeze the default overworld download to a commit or
   tag.
2. **Same Iris seed.** Create with `seed=1337` (Bukkit) or the positional
   `1337` (modded), as in
   [02 - Getting Started](/iris/02-getting-started).
3. **Same radius and center.** Modded center is fixed at chunk `0,0`, so
   use `center-x=0 center-z=0` on Bukkit.
4. **Same height range.** The dimension's min and max Y define the hash
   window. Changing height changes the hash by definition.
5. **Use `threads=1` when hunting order dependence.** Multi-threaded
   scans must still match the serial result.
6. **Reset mantle on both sides** when you are comparing regeneration
   purity. Bukkit defaults to `reset-mantle=true`. Modded always resets.
7. **Do not confuse pregeneration with hashing.** GoldenHash regenerates
   into buffers and ignores whatever pregeneration wrote. Pregeneration
   is still worth running as a stress gate before or after
   ([07 - Pregeneration](/iris/07-pregeneration)).
8. **Disposable worlds only.** Buffers mean no block writes. Still,
   `reset-mantle` deletes the world's mantle files. The diagnosis path
   also deletes mantle chunks around the failing chunk.

## Reference

### What is hashed

- **Blocks:** every local column `x,z` in `0..15` and every `y` from the
  engine or world minimum height (inclusive) to the maximum (exclusive).
  Each block state key (for example `minecraft:stone`) is fed into a
  per-chunk SHA-256 digest.
- **Biomes:** the same height span sampled every 4 blocks in x, y, and z
  (`BIOME_STEP = 4`). A null biome sample hashes as `minecraft:plains`
  (`GoldenHashEngine.FALLBACK_BIOME_KEY`).
- **Combined:** SHA-256 over the per-chunk lines sorted by packed chunk
  key, stored as `#combined=<hex>`.
- **Not touched:** Minecraft region files. The scan generates into
  buffers only.
- **Deleted when `reset-mantle` is true:** every file directly inside the
  engine's mantle data folder, after a `saveAll`. This is the whole
  world's mantle, not only the scanned square, despite what the in-game
  help text implies.
- **Reset failure aborts the scan.** If any mantle region file cannot be
  deleted, or the IO layer cannot be invalidated, the command reports the
  failure. It then stops instead of capturing over a partial reset.
- **Recapture note (2026-08):** marker selection in object placement,
  cave floor and ceiling markers, and floating-island placement ordering
  are now seed-deterministic. They previously drew from unseeded or
  iteration-order-dependent randomness. Golden files captured before this
  change for packs using those systems are not reproducible. Recapture
  them.

### Golden file location and name

| Platform | Golden directory |
|----------|------------------|
| Bukkit-family plugin | Iris data folder `golden/` (for example `plugins/Iris/golden/`) |
| Fabric / Forge / NeoForge | `<configDir>/irisworldgen/golden/` |

```
<dimensionLoadKey>-s<seed>-c<centerChunkX>x<centerChunkZ>-r<radius>.hashes
```

Example: `overworld-s1337-c0x0-r22.hashes`.

The seed in that name is `World.getSeed()` on Bukkit and the Iris engine
seed (`engine.getSeedManager().getSeed()`) on mod loaders. For a world
created through `/iris create` with an explicit seed they are the same
value.

File layout:

```
#iris-goldenhash v1
#world=<world name>
#dim=<dimension load key>
#seed=<seed>
#mc=<platform Minecraft version string>
#minY=<min> maxY=<max>
#center=<cx>,<cz>
#radius=<chunks>
<chunkX> <chunkZ> <blockSha256> <biomeSha256>
...
#combined=<sha256>
```

On mismatch the engine also writes:

- `<file>.new` — the current body plus its combined hash
- `<file>.diag-c<x>x<z>.txt` — diagnosis of the first mismatched chunk
- `<file>.deep/` or `<file>.deep-verify/` — per-chunk non-air block dumps
  when `deep=true` (Bukkit only). The `-verify` suffix is used when a
  golden file already exists

### Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `CAPTURE` | Always write a new golden file |
| `VERIFY` | Fail if no golden file exists. Otherwise compare and report MATCH or MISMATCH |
| `AUTO` | Capture when the file is missing, verify when it exists |

The Bukkit command is hard-wired to `AUTO`. Modded exposes `capture` and
`verify` literals and falls back to `AUTO`.

### Commands

Bukkit:

```
/iris developer goldenhash world=<world> radius=<chunks> threads=<n> center-x=<cx> center-z=<cz> reset-mantle=<bool> deep=<bool>
```

Alias `gold`. Defaults: `radius=8`, `threads=8`, `center-x=0`,
`center-z=0`, `reset-mantle=true`, `deep=false`. Radius must be at least
0. The target must be a loaded Iris world with a live engine. Metadata
comes from `World.getSeed()`, `Bukkit.getBukkitVersion()`, and the
world's min and max height. Nothing stops a second Bukkit scan from
starting while one is running. Do not start one.

Modded (Fabric / Forge / NeoForge):

```
/iris goldenhash [radius] [threads] [capture|verify]
```

Alias `gold`. Defaults: radius `8`, threads `8`, mode `AUTO`. The command
tree accepts radius `0..256` and threads `1..64`. Center is always chunk
`0,0`, mantle is always reset, and deep dumps are not exposed. A second
scan is refused while one is running.

While any scan is active, Iris suspends engine mantle maintenance
(trimming and plate unloading) process-wide so maintenance cannot perturb
the comparison.

### Offline generation probe (not a GoldenHash file)

`./gradlew :probe:genProbe -PprobePack=…` builds an offline engine for
dimension key `overworld` at seed `1337`. It validates the pack, generates
a chunk spiral into buffers, and prints per-chunk hashes to stdout. It never
reads or writes `iris-goldenhash v1` files, so it cannot be compared
against a baseline. Use it as a headless regression signal. Use in-game
GoldenHash for cross-platform gates. Probe details:
[31 - Operator Runbooks](/iris/31-operator-runbooks).

### Release gate

Release requires GoldenHash `VERIFY` to pass on all four platforms with
the same combined hash for the shared pack and seed
([86 - Maintainer - Release Checklist](/iris/86-maintainer-release-checklist)).
An unexplained change in that hash blocks the release
([87 - Maintainer - Release Readiness](/iris/87-maintainer-release-readiness)).
