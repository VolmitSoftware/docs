This page takes you from a working Iris install to a world you can stand in, a small pregenerated area, and an open Studio session for editing packs. It's written for whoever is running the server, and assumes nothing about pack authoring. Command syntax differs between the plugin and the mods, so each step gives both forms.

Full command trees and permissions: [04 - Commands & Permissions](/iris/04-commands-permissions). World lifecycle detail: [06 - Worlds & Lifecycle](/iris/06-worlds-lifecycle). Studio detail: [10 - Studio & VSCode Schemas](/iris/10-studio-vscode-schemas).

## What you'll end up with

One disposable Iris world built from the `overworld` pack, entered and generating chunks, with roughly a 45×45-chunk area pregenerated, plus a separate Studio session pointed at the live pack. Use seed `1337` throughout. Changing seeds while you're still diagnosing something makes every comparison meaningless.

Work through the sections in order and confirm each one before moving on. Confirm the world loaded before teleporting; confirm ordinary chunks generate around you before starting a pregen; confirm the Studio world is genuinely separate from your production world before editing files. Skipping a check doesn't save time here, because Iris failures surface late and in the wrong place.

## Prerequisites

- Iris installed and verified per [01 - Installation & Platforms](/iris/01-installation-platforms)
- A Java 25 server or mod instance running
- Operator access on Bukkit (the `iris.all` permission), or permission level 2 / gamemaster on modded for anything that mutates state
- The managed `overworld` and `underworld` packs present, or your own pack installed under the platform's packs directory

## The one syntax rule that trips everyone up

On the plugin, Iris uses the Director command framework, and it has a hard rule: **only required parameters accept a bare positional value. Every optional parameter must be given as `key=value`.** A leftover positional token isn't ignored — it's an error, and the command fails.

```text
/iris create myworld type=overworld seed=1337     correct
/iris create myworld overworld 1337               fails: unexpected argument
```

Parameters marked contextual (like `world` on pregen, which normally comes from where you're standing) also never take a positional, so name them with `key=` when you need to override them.

Modded is Brigadier and works the way you'd expect: everything is positional, in order, and pregen options are literal flag words.

| Platform | Required args | Optional args | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plugin (Bukkit) | Positional, in declaration order | Must be `key=value` | `/iris create myworld type=overworld seed=1337` |
| Mod (Fabric / Forge / NeoForge) | Positional | Further positional tokens or literal flags | `/iris create myworld overworld 1337` |

Director also matches command and parameter names fuzzily, so shortenings and near-misses often resolve. That's convenient but don't rely on it in scripts — write the real names.

## 1. Create a world

### Plugin

```text
/iris create <name> [type=…] [seed=…] [main=true|false] [overwrite=true|false]
```

| Parameter | Aliases | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | `world-name` | required | The world name. The only parameter that takes a positional value |
| `type` | `dimension`, `pack` | `default` | Which pack/dimension to generate. The literal `default` is resolved at runtime through `generator.defaultWorldType` (stock value `overworld`), so it follows your config rather than being hardcoded |
| `seed` | — | `1337` | World seed |
| `main` | `main-world` | `false` | Promote this world to the server's main world. See below — it does not take effect until a restart |
| `overwrite` | `force` | `false` | Replace an existing world in place instead of creating a new one. This is a staged, restart-to-publish operation, not something to reach for casually |

The command itself has alias `c`.

`main=true` on a non-Folia server registers a JVM shutdown hook. On shutdown it copies `data/`, `datapacks/`, and `players/` from the current level root along with the Iris dimension folder into a new level directory, then rewrites `server.properties` with the new `level-name` and `level-seed`. Nothing changes while the server is up. On Folia the promotion is applied inline during staging instead, and rolls back the `bukkit.yml` entry and the staged folder if it fails.

**Names Iris refuses.** `iris` and `benchmark` are rejected outright (case-insensitive) and Iris suggests something like `irisworld`. Before those checks, the name also has to be a safe single path segment matching `[a-z0-9_-]`, so anything containing `/`, `\`, or `..` is rejected, as is any name that would collide with a vanilla world slot — your server's `level-name`, `<level-name>_nether`, or `<level-name>_the_end`. Those produce a different message about only Iris-managed worlds being changeable.

**Already exists.** Without `overwrite=true`, create aborts if the managed dimension folder is already there. That folder lives at `<level-root>/dimensions/iris/<name>`, not next to your server jar.

**Folia.** Runtime creation is disabled. Iris stages the world files, installs the pack snapshot, registers the world in `bukkit.yml`, and tells you to restart. After the restart the world generates and loads on its own from that registration — you don't need `/iris load`.

**Everything else.** Create builds the world immediately through `IrisToolbelt.createWorld()`, as a production world (not a studio world).

```text
/iris create myworld type=overworld seed=1337
```

Now run `/iris worlds` (alias `accesslist`). It prints two lists — Iris worlds and plain Bukkit worlds. On a non-Folia server `myworld` must appear under Iris worlds. On Folia, success is the staging-and-restart message; restart before continuing.

### Mod

```text
/iris create <name> [pack] [seed]
```

| Parameter | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | required | Dimension id. A bare name is normalized into the `irisworldgen` namespace, so `myworld` becomes `irisworldgen:myworld` |
| `pack` | `overworld` | Pack key. Use the `pack:dimension` form when the pack's dimension key differs from its name |
| `seed` | `1337` | Long seed |

Alias `c`. You can't pass `seed` without also passing `pack`.

The `pack:dimension` form has to be **quoted** — `"overworld:overworld"` — because Brigadier's unquoted string type doesn't accept a colon. Iris's own help text says the same thing.

If the pack is not installed, create refuses without downloading anything. Install `overworld` or `underworld` with the matching `pack=` download command, or install another pack with `link=<zip-url>`, restart, and then run create again.

```text
/iris create myworld overworld 1337
```

There's no separate load step on modded. The same world management also lives under `/iris world create|enable`, where `create` is simply an alias of `enable`. That form requires the pack argument and has no `overworld` default.

Confirm with `/iris world status`, which lists each loaded Iris level with its pack and dimension key. Then run `/iris info` to check the seed. `/iris info` takes an optional greedy string that acts as a **substring filter** across dimension id, generator identity, and pack key — not a dimension selector — so `/iris info myworld` narrows the listing. The seed is only printed to gamemasters; at lower permission levels the line simply omits it.

## 2. Load a world (plugin only)

```text
/iris load <world>
```

The real command node is `loadWorld`, with alias `import`; `/iris load` reaches it through fuzzy matching. It requires the managed dimension directory to already exist on disk, then loads through `BukkitWorldReconciler` and registers the world with the server.

This one is **player-origin only** — the console cannot run it. On a headless server, load worlds by having them registered in `bukkit.yml` (which create already does) and restarting, or run it as a player.

Modded worlds created with `/iris create` or `/iris world enable` are already injected. Teleport instead.

## 3. Teleport

### Plugin

```text
/iris teleport <world> [player=…]
```

Alias `tp`. The world is positional; the player is optional and therefore keyed — `/iris tp myworld player=Notch`. Left out, it targets whoever ran the command, so console needs to name a player explicitly or it reports that the player doesn't exist. The teleport itself is performed asynchronously where the platform allows it.

```text
/iris tp myworld
```

You've passed this gate when the teleport completes and chunks generate normally around spawn. If the teleport target doesn't exist, go back to the create/load step — don't push on to pregen.

### Mod

```text
/iris teleport <dimension> [player]
/iris tp <dimension> [player]
```

Dimension is a loaded-level argument and tab-completes Iris dimensions; a non-Iris dimension is rejected. Console must name a player. You land at x=8.5, z=8.5 in that dimension, at the `MOTION_BLOCKING` height for that column, and Iris force-loads the chunk with a ticket if it isn't loaded yet.

```text
/iris tp irisworldgen:myworld
```

Success is entry into `irisworldgen:myworld` with `/iris info myworld` still reporting the pack and seed you expect.

## 4. Pregenerate

Radius is in **blocks**, measured from the center outward, and one pregeneration job runs server-wide at a time.

The block radius is converted to an inclusive chunk box, so a 352-block radius at `0,0` covers chunks -22 through 22 on both axes: **45 × 45 = 2,025 chunks**, or 720 × 720 blocks of actual generated area. The command's own feedback describes the request as 704 × 704 blocks (radius × 2); the extra chunk on each edge is the inclusive rounding. Pick your radius knowing that chunk count, not the block number, is what determines how long this takes.

### Plugin

```text
/iris pregen start <radius> [world=…] [center=x,z|me] [gui=true|false] [serial=true|false]
```

| Parameter | Aliases | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `radius` | `size` | required | Radius in blocks; must be greater than 0. The only positional parameter |
| `world` | — | your current world | Target world. Contextual, so it must be keyed when you override it — typically when running from console |
| `center` | `middle` | `0,0` | Center point. `me` uses the running player's position |
| `gui` | — | `true` | Open the pregen progress window. Set false on a headless server |
| `serial` | — | `false` | Generate one chunk at a time. Much slower, but the safe option when parallel generation is destabilizing the server. Requires a Paper-compatible server |

```text
/iris pregen start 352 world=myworld center=0,0 gui=false
```

Immediately run `/iris pregen status`. It should report a 2,025-chunk job that advances without a growing failure count.

Control it with `/iris pregen stop` (alias `x`), `/iris pregen pause`, and `/iris pregen status`. **`resume` is an alias of `pause`, and `pause` is a toggle** — there's no distinct resume command, so running either one on a paused job resumes it and on a running job pauses it.

### Mod

```text
/iris pregen start <radius> [dimension] [at <x> <z>] [gui] [sync] [nocache]
```

| Piece | What it does |
|---|---|
| `radius` | Blocks, 1–100000 |
| `dimension` | Optional target level; defaults to the dimension you're in |
| `at x z` | Optional center; defaults to 0, 0 |
| `gui` | Ask for the progress map window on the server display. Silently ignored when no GUI can be launched |
| `sync` | Synchronous chunk writes |
| `nocache` | Disable the resumable checkpoint cache. Caching is on by default, which is what lets a stopped job pick up where it left off |

The three flags are combinable in any order and each may appear once, but **`at <x> <z>` must come before any flag.** `/iris pregen start 100 gui at 0 0` is a syntax error; `/iris pregen start 100 at 0 0 gui` is fine.

```text
/iris pregen start 352 irisworldgen:myworld at 0 0 sync
```

Run `/iris pregen status` right away and confirm the target dimension, total, and generated count. Stop before retrying with different flags. As on Bukkit, `pause` and `resume` are the same toggle. Progress shows in the client mod HUD when present, otherwise a boss bar or the console.

## 5. Open a Studio

Studio worlds are transient. They're discarded when you close them and any leftovers are purged at startup. Crucially, a Studio world reads the **live** pack directory and hotloads JSON and object edits into newly generated chunks. Production worlds never do this — they read the frozen snapshot copied into the world at creation. That difference is the reason Studio exists, and the reason pack edits appear to do nothing on a production world.

### Plugin

```text
/iris studio create [name=…] [template=…]
/iris studio open <dimension> [seed=…]
/iris studio vscode [dimension=…]
/iris studio close
```

| Command | Aliases | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `create` | `+` | Both parameters are optional, so **neither takes a positional value** — use `name=mypack`. With no template it scaffolds a minimal starter pack (`dimensions/`, `regions/`, `biomes/`, `generators/` with one of each). With a template it copies an existing packs entry, downloading it if needed |
| `open` | `o` | Opens a temporary studio world for a pack. `dimension` is required and positional; `seed` is optional (alias `s`) and defaults to `1337` |
| `vscode` | `vsc` | Writes and opens a `.code-workspace` with live registry schemas. `dimension` is optional, so keyed only, and defaults to `default` |
| `close` | `x` | Discards the studio world |

The studio group itself has aliases `std` and `s`. Default create name is `studio`; if a project by that name already exists, Iris picks the next free name rather than failing.

```text
/iris studio open overworld seed=1337
/iris studio vscode dimension=overworld
```

### Mod

```text
/iris studio create [name] [template]
/iris studio open <pack> [seed]
/iris studio vscode [pack]
/iris studio update [pack]
/iris studio close
```

| Command | Aliases | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `create` | `+` | Name defaults to `studio`, template defaults to **`example`**. This differs from the plugin, where omitting the template scaffolds a starter pack instead. The template pack must already be installed |
| `open` | `o` | Pack is required; seed defaults to `1337` |
| `vscode` | `vsc` | Writes the workspace and opens it |
| `update` | — | Regenerates the workspace schemas without opening anything |
| `close` | `x` | Discards the studio world |

Group aliases are `std` and `s`.

```text
/iris studio open overworld 1337
/iris studio vscode overworld
```

A number of Bukkit studio and content tools deliberately refuse on modded and print an explanatory message rather than half-working: `importvanilla` (`importv`, `iv`), `loot`, `profile`, `spawn`/`summon`, `objects`/`find-objects`, the object `we`, `studio`, and `convert` subcommands, structure `import`/`import-all`/`reimport`, and datapack `ingest`/`pull`/`remove`. Do that work on a Bukkit server and copy the pack folder across.

The Studio gate passes when the transient world opens, the workspace points at the live `packs/overworld/` tree, and saving a valid JSON change produces a hotload result in-game. Close it with `/iris studio close` and confirm your production `myworld` is still there and unaffected.

## The whole first session

1. Confirm the pack: `overworld` (or yours) exists under the platform packs directory.
2. Create the world using the form for your platform.
3. On Folia only: restart after the staging message. The world comes back on its own.
4. Teleport in and fly around a little to confirm chunks generate.
5. Optional: `/iris pregen start 352 …` for a 45×45-chunk area.
6. Optional: `/iris studio open <pack>` and use the VSCode schemas for block, item, and entity autocomplete — mod content is included in those schemas on mod loaders.

The session is genuinely finished when you restart the server cleanly, the production world loads again, and it generates new chunks from its copied pack snapshot. Remove a disposable world through the lifecycle command after evacuating players, never by deleting folders — see [06 - Worlds & Lifecycle](/iris/06-worlds-lifecycle).

## Common pitfalls

| Pitfall | What actually happens | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| Bukkit optional args passed positionally | Hard parse error, command does nothing | Write `seed=1337`, not a bare second token |
| `/iris studio create mypack` | Fails — both params are optional so neither is positional | `/iris studio create name=mypack` |
| `/iris pack validate` with no argument | Validates every installed pack | Name one with `pack=<key>` to check a single pack |
| World named `iris` or `benchmark` | Create rejected | Pick another name, e.g. `irisworld` |
| Editing `packs/<pack>` after creating a production world | **No effect** on that world, ever | Production engines read `<world>/iris/pack`. Push changes with `/iris developer update-world world=<world> pack=<dimension> confirm=true` and restart, or accept that only new chunks change. Studio reads the live pack |
| Expecting pack edits to change existing chunks | Only newly generated chunks use the new config | Fly to unexplored terrain, pregen a fresh radius, or use a Studio world |
| Folia: create then teleport immediately | The world isn't live yet | Restart after the staging message, then teleport |
| Modded: new pack's heights or biomes missing | The forced datapack wasn't applied before registries loaded | Restart once with the pack already installed |
| `/iris load` from console | Player-origin only; console can't run it | Rely on the `bukkit.yml` registration plus a restart, or run it as a player |
| `/iris load` on modded | No such subcommand | Use create or `world enable`, then teleport |
| Modded `pack:dimension` unquoted | Brigadier rejects the colon | Quote it: `"overworld:overworld"` |
| Modded pregen flags before `at x z` | Syntax error | Put `at <x> <z>` before any flag |
| Starting a pregen while one is running | Start fails | `/iris pregen stop` first |
| `/iris pregen resume` expected to only resume | It's an alias of `pause`, which toggles | Check `/iris pregen status` instead of assuming |
| Studio closed mid-edit | The studio world is discarded | Your edits are on disk in `packs/` and survive. Reopen the studio |
| No pack exists after first boot | Normal: Iris never downloads packs during startup | Run `/iris download pack=overworld`, `/iris download pack=underworld`, or `/iris download link=https://host/pack.zip`, then restart. An offline install must contain each complete pack tree |
| Relying on `type=default` | Resolves through `generator.defaultWorldType`, which someone may have changed | Name the pack explicitly: `type=overworld` |
