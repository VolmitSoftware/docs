A menu file is a JSON document describing one holographic menu: where it sits relative to the player, how it behaves while open, and which components it contains. This page covers file discovery, menu ids, every top-level key, the component wrapper, and the discriminator enums that select component, icon and action payloads. The payloads themselves are documented in [04 - Components & Hitboxes.md](/holoui/04-components-hitboxes), [05 - Icons.md](/holoui/05-icons) and [06 - Actions.md](/holoui/06-actions).

## Source of truth

| Concern | File |
|---|---|
| Menu object | `src/main/java/art/arcane/holoui/config/MenuDefinitionData.java` |
| Component wrapper | `src/main/java/art/arcane/holoui/config/MenuComponentData.java` |
| Discriminators | `src/main/java/art/arcane/holoui/enums/` |
| Discovery and parsing | `src/main/java/art/arcane/holoui/config/ConfigManager.java` |
| Positioning | `src/main/java/art/arcane/holoui/menu/MenuSession.java` |
| JSON Schema | `schema/holoui.schema.json` |

## File location and menu id

Menu files live in the plugin data folder. The plugin name is `holoui`, so `getDataFolder()` resolves to `plugins/holoui`:

```
plugins/holoui/menus/     menu definition files
plugins/holoui/images/    image assets referenced by textImage / animatedTextImage icons
```

Both directories are created on first enable if absent.

### Id derivation

The menu id comes from the file name, never from the file contents. `ConfigManager` computes `FilenameUtils.getBaseName(file.getName())` — the file name with the last extension removed — and assigns it with `MenuDefinitionData.setId(...)`, overwriting anything the JSON supplied.

| File | Menu id |
|---|---|
| `menus/shop.json` | `shop` |
| `menus/main_menu.json` | `main_menu` |
| `menus/Shop.JSON` | `Shop` |

Ids are case sensitive. They are the key used by `/holoui open <id>` or `/holoui open menu=<id>` ([02 - Commands & Permissions.md](/holoui/02-commands-permissions)) and by `HoloUiService.open(plugin, player, String menuId)` and `menuIds()` ([14 - API - Menus.md](/holoui/14-api-menus)). The bare form is rewritten to `menu=<id>` before Director runs.

`id` is therefore not a menu key. `MenuDefinitionData` carries an `id` field, so a JSON `"id"` deserializes into it, but the loader immediately replaces it with the file base name. Setting it has no effect.

### Extension and directory layout

Only top-level `*.json` files are loaded. The extension match is case insensitive, so `Shop.JSON` loads as `Shop`. A file with any other extension is skipped, which is why the loader's log lines can assume the suffix (`Menu config "%s.json" …`).

Subdirectories are skipped too, along with everything inside them, and skipping is silent: no parse error, no per-file log line. The boot scan reports the count once at `FINE` (`menus: ignored <n> entries that are not top level json files.`). Keep `menus/` flat.

The boot scan and both watchers share one predicate, so a file that is not registered at startup is not registered by a later edit either.

### Reloading

Two watchers run against `menus/`. Session lifecycle is covered in [11 - Runtime Architecture.md](/holoui/11-runtime-architecture).

| Interval | Detects | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| 5 ticks | modified files | file is re-parsed, all open sessions of that id are destroyed, affected players receive a notice plus `ENTITY_EXPERIENCE_ORB_PICKUP`, the registry entry is replaced |
| 20 ticks | created / deleted files | created files are parsed and registered; deleted files unregister the id and destroy its open sessions |

Both watchers see nested and non-`.json` paths and skip them, exactly as the boot scan does.

Changes under `images/` trigger a visual refresh of open sessions on the same cadence.

### Parse failures

A zero-byte file logs `Menu config "<id>.json" is empty, ignoring.` and is skipped. Any other failure — malformed JSON, an unknown `type` discriminator — logs a stack trace and leaves the previously registered definition, if any, in place. A failed file never partially registers.

## Parsing behavior

Menu files are parsed with `art.arcane.volmlib.util.bukkit.json.BukkitJson`, a Gson instance configured with `setLenient()`.

- Lenient mode accepts unquoted keys, single-quoted strings and trailing commas.
- Unknown JSON keys are silently ignored. A `"$schema"` key added for editor tooling is harmless.
- Collection-typed keys accept a single object in place of a one-element array, via `SingleCollectionTypeFactory`. `"components": {…}` parses the same as `"components": [{…}]`. This applies to `components`, `actions`, `trueActions` and `falseActions`.

There is no load-time validation. The plugin does not check menu files against `holoui.schema.json` or against anything else. A file that parses as JSON registers. Structural problems — a missing `offset`, a missing `components`, a component with no `data` — surface as an exception when a player opens the menu, not when the file is loaded.

## Top-level keys

The `vector3` type is a JSON array of exactly three numbers, `[x, y, z]`.

| Key | Type | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `offset` | `vector3` | yes | none | Position of the menu center relative to the opening player. See [Offset semantics](#offset-semantics). |
| `components` | array of component | yes | none | The components that make up the menu. May also be given as a single component object. |
| `lockPosition` | boolean | no | `false` | When true the player cannot move while the menu is open. `PlayerMoveEvent` has its destination X/Y/Z rewritten back to the origin and any non-zero velocity is zeroed. Rotation is unaffected. This freeze branch runs before the movement range check. |
| `followPlayer` | boolean | no | `false` | When true the menu re-anchors to the player's new location on every move, respawn and teleport. When false the menu stays where it was placed. Ignored while `lockPosition` is true, because the freeze branch returns before the follow branch runs. |
| `maxDistance` | number | no | `6.0E7` | Maximum distance in blocks between the player and the menu center before the menu closes with reason `MOVED_OUT_OF_RANGE`. Clamped to `[0, 6.0E7]`; `null` or absent yields `6.0E7`. |
| `closeOnDeath` | boolean | no | `false` | Close the menu on `PlayerDeathEvent`, with reason `DEATH`. Independent of the respawn check, which closes with reason `RESPAWN` whenever the respawn location is out of range or in another world. |
| `closeOnTeleport` | boolean | no | `false` | Close the menu on `PlayerTeleportEvent`, with reason `TELEPORT`. When false, a teleport that lands in range moves the menu with the player; a teleport that lands out of range or in another world closes it regardless of this flag. |

`lockPosition` and `followPlayer` are separate axes: `lockPosition` constrains the player, `followPlayer` constrains the menu. A menu with neither set stays fixed in the world while the player is free to walk away from it, up to `maxDistance`.

Any world change invalidates the session regardless of `maxDistance`, because the range check requires the player's location and the menu center to share a world.

### Offset semantics

`offset` is interpreted in a player-relative frame captured when the menu opens:

| Axis | Direction |
|---|---|
| `+X` | to the player's right |
| `+Y` | up |
| `+Z` | forward, away from the player |

Mechanically, the menu center is the player's **feet** `Location` plus the offset vector, with the X component negated on load:

```java
this.centerPoint = p.getLocation().clone().add(offset);
this.offset = data.getOffset().clone().multiply(new Vector(-1, 1, 1));
```

At open, the yaw of the player's eye at that instant is recorded as `initialY`, and every component is rotated about `player.getEyeLocation()` by that yaw. This converts the stored world-axis vector into the player-relative frame above. Yaw-only rotation leaves Y untouched, so the vertical origin is the player's feet, while rotation pivots on the eye.

The recorded yaw is captured once. Subsequent movement with `followPlayer` translates the menu but keeps its original facing.

The range check is `centerPoint.distanceSquared(loc) <= maxDistance * maxDistance + offsetDistance`, so the effective allowance includes the offset length.

The menu `offset` is **not** multiplied by the `uiScale` setting. Component offsets are.

## The component wrapper

Each entry of `components` is an object with exactly three meaningful keys. It is the Java record `MenuComponentData(String id, Vector offset, ComponentData data)`.

| Key | Type | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | yes | none | Identifier for this component within the menu. Used as the map key for API icon updates (`HoloMenuHandle.setText` / `setItem` / `setIcon`). Duplicates resolve first-wins; later components with that id are ignored. |
| `offset` | `vector3` | yes | none | Position relative to the menu center. Same axis convention as the menu `offset`. |
| `data` | object | yes | none | The component payload. Its `type` key is the discriminator. |

### Component offset scaling

The component offset is multiplied by `(-uiScale, uiScale, uiScale)` on construction:

```java
double scale = HuiSettings.uiScale();
this.offset = data.offset().clone().multiply(new Vector(-scale, scale, scale));
```

`uiScale` is the `UI_SCALE` setting in `plugins/holoui/settings.json`, default `1.00`, clamped to `[0.25, 4.00]` — see [01 - Installation & Configuration.md](/holoui/01-installation-configuration). Menu offsets are not scaled, so raising `uiScale` spreads components apart around a center that does not move.

### The `data` discriminator

`data.type` selects the payload class. The adapter (`EnumType`) removes `type` from the object and hands the remainder to the type-specific adapter, so `type` never collides with a payload key. A missing `type` raises `Missing type`; an unrecognized value raises `Unknown type: <value>`. Either failure aborts the whole file.

The same mechanism applies at two further levels, both nested inside `data`:

| Level | Key | Enum | Where it appears | Documented in |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| component payload | `data.type` | `MenuComponentType` | every entry of `components` | [04 - Components & Hitboxes.md](/holoui/04-components-hitboxes) |
| icon payload | `type` | `MenuIconType` | `data.icon` on `button` and `decoration`; `data.trueIcon` and `data.falseIcon` on `toggle` | [05 - Icons.md](/holoui/05-icons) |
| action payload | `type` | `MenuActionType` | every entry of `data.actions` on `button`; `data.trueActions` and `data.falseActions` on `toggle` | [06 - Actions.md](/holoui/06-actions) |

## Enum values

The tables give the canonical JSON spellings. The three `type` discriminators accept only those spellings. Gson-backed command and sound `source` fields also accept the Java enum constant names shown in the next column, including `GLOBAL`, `PLAYER`, and `MUSIC`; exports and the schema use the canonical lowercase forms.

### `MenuComponentType` — `data.type`

| JSON | Java constant | Payload class |
|---|---|---|
| `button` | `BUTTON` | `ButtonComponentData` |
| `decoration` | `DECO` | `DecoComponentData` |
| `toggle` | `TOGGLE` | `ToggleComponentData` |

The JSON spelling is `decoration`; the constant is `DECO`.

### `MenuIconType` — icon `type`

| JSON | Java constant | Payload class | Usable in menu JSON |
|---|---|---|---|
| `item` | `ITEM` | `ItemIconData` | yes |
| `customItem` | `CUSTOM_ITEM` | `CustomItemIconData` | yes |
| `animatedTextImage` | `ANIMATED_TEXT_IMAGE` | `AnimatedImageData` | yes |
| `textImage` | `TEXT_IMAGE` | `TextImageIconData` | yes |
| `text` | `TEXT` | `TextIconData` | yes |
| `itemStack` | `ITEM_STACK` | none | no |

`itemStack` declares a `null` payload class in the enum. `EnumType` filters null-typed constants out of its adapter table, so the spelling fails deserialization with `Unknown type: …`. It exists to carry a live `ItemStack` handed in through the Java API and has no JSON form.

`customItem` is functional and declared in `holoui.schema.json`. See [08 - Custom Items & Item Providers.md](/holoui/08-custom-items-item-providers).

### `MenuActionType` — action `type`

| JSON | Java constant | Payload class |
|---|---|---|
| `command` | `COMMAND` | `CommandActionData` |
| `sound` | `SOUND` | `SoundActionData` |

### `MenuActionCommandSource` — `source` on a `command` action

Canonical spellings come from Gson `@SerializedName`, and one does not match its constant name.

| JSON | Java constant | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `player` | `PLAYER` | dispatched as the clicking player |
| `server` | `GLOBAL` | dispatched from the console |

### `SoundSource` — `source` on a `sound` action

| JSON | Java constant | Bukkit `SoundCategory` |
|---|---|---|
| `master` | `MASTER` | `MASTER` |
| `music` | `MUSIC` | `MUSIC` |
| `record` | `RECORD` | `RECORDS` |
| `weather` | `WEATHER` | `WEATHER` |
| `block` | `BLOCK` | `BLOCKS` |
| `hostile` | `HOSTILE` | `HOSTILE` |
| `neutral` | `NEUTRAL` | `NEUTRAL` |
| `player` | `PLAYER` | `PLAYERS` |
| `ambient` | `AMBIENT` | `AMBIENT` |
| `voice` | `VOICE` | `VOICE` |

Three spellings differ from their `SoundCategory` counterpart: `record`/`RECORDS`, `block`/`BLOCKS`, `player`/`PLAYERS`.

An unrecognized command source becomes `null` and therefore uses the `player` default. An unrecognized sound source becomes `null` and therefore uses the `master` default.

## Examples

### Minimal

`plugins/holoui/menus/hello.json`, menu id `hello`. One decorative text label, 1.5 blocks above the player's feet and 2 blocks in front.

```json
{
  "offset": [0, 1.5, 2],
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "greeting",
      "offset": [0, 0, 0],
      "data": {
        "type": "decoration",
        "icon": {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "&aHello, %player_name%"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Full

`plugins/holoui/menus/shop.json`, menu id `shop`. One of each component type, both action types, a custom hitbox, and every optional top-level key set explicitly.

```json
{
  "offset": [0, 1.6, 2.25],
  "lockPosition": true,
  "followPlayer": false,
  "maxDistance": 8,
  "closeOnDeath": true,
  "closeOnTeleport": true,
  "components": [
    {
      "id": "title",
      "offset": [0, 0.75, 0],
      "data": {
        "type": "decoration",
        "icon": {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "&6&lServer Shop"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "open-market",
      "offset": [-0.6, 0, 0],
      "data": {
        "type": "button",
        "highlightModifier": 0.1,
        "icon": {
          "type": "item",
          "item": "minecraft:emerald",
          "count": 1
        },
        "hitbox": {
          "width": 0.5,
          "height": 0.5,
          "offset": [0, 0, 0],
          "anchor": "button"
        },
        "actions": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "market open",
            "source": "player"
          },
          {
            "type": "sound",
            "sound": "minecraft:ui.button.click",
            "source": "master",
            "volume": 1.0,
            "pitch": 1.0
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "toggle-notifications",
      "offset": [0.6, 0, 0],
      "data": {
        "type": "toggle",
        "highlightModifier": 0.1,
        "condition": "%shop_notifications%",
        "expectedValue": "true",
        "trueIcon": {
          "type": "textImage",
          "path": "shop/bell_on.png"
        },
        "falseIcon": {
          "type": "textImage",
          "path": "shop/bell_off.png"
        },
        "trueActions": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "shop notify off",
            "source": "player"
          }
        ],
        "falseActions": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "shop notify on",
            "source": "player"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Both examples use only keys and value shapes declared by `schema/holoui.schema.json`, including `closeOnTeleport`.

Placeholder syntax used in `text` and `condition` is covered in [07 - Expressions & Placeholders.md](/holoui/07-expressions-placeholders).

## Relationship to `holoui.schema.json`

`schema/holoui.schema.json` is a JSON Schema 2020-12 document with `$id` `https://volmit.com/holoui/schema.json`. It is checked into the repository under `schema/`, is not bundled into the plugin jar, is not read at runtime, and is not applied by the loader. It exists for editor tooling: point an IDE's JSON schema mapping at it to get completion and inline validation on files under `menus/`, or add a `"$schema"` key to a menu file, which Gson ignores. See [12 - Web Editor & Schemas.md](/holoui/12-web-editor-schemas).

Its top-level `required` is `["offset", "components"]`, and its `properties` are `offset`, `lockPosition`, `followPlayer`, `maxDistance`, `closeOnDeath`, `closeOnTeleport`, and `components`. The icon `type` enum includes `text`, `textImage`, `animatedTextImage`, `item`, and `customItem`.

Because the schema is advisory rather than enforced:

- Some files the schema rejects still load because runtime coercion and collection handling are broader than the schema.
- A file the schema accepts can still fail to load, because the schema does not enforce every runtime nullability and open-time rule, and it does not model the API-only `itemStack` icon type.

### Schema and implementation differences

| Item | Schema | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| `itemStack` icon type | absent (intentional; API-only) | present in `MenuIconType`, not deserializable from JSON |
| `components` cardinality | `type: array` | array, or a single object via `SingleCollectionTypeFactory` |
| single-object collections | not modelled | accepted for `components`, `actions`, `trueActions`, `falseActions` |
| unknown keys | permitted; `additionalProperties` is unconstrained everywhere except `hitbox` | ignored |

`$defs/hitbox` is the only object in the schema that sets `additionalProperties: false`.

`HoloUiSchemaContractTest` structurally pins selected high-risk fields: `closeOnTeleport`, integer item counts, non-blank image/item paths, non-empty animation sources, optional integer animation speed, and unrestricted integer `customModelValue`. It does not run a general JSON Schema validator or prove full parser equivalence.

`schema/holoui-preview.schema.json` sits in the same directory but is unrelated to menu files. It describes the container-preview document format under `src/main/resources/previews/`, covered in [09 - Container Previews.md](/holoui/09-container-previews).

## Runtime notes

- The file name always wins over a JSON `"id"`.
- The menu `offset` anchors to the player's feet, while rotation pivots on the eye location.
- The menu `offset` X component is negated on load, and component offsets are negated and scaled by `uiScale`. The menu offset is not scaled.
- `lockPosition` bypasses both movement range validation and `followPlayer` handling for ordinary move events. Respawn and teleport retain their own range and close checks.
- `maxDistance` allowance includes the offset length, so the effective walk-away radius is slightly larger than the configured value.
- `decoration` maps to the `DECO` constant, `server` maps to `GLOBAL`, and `record` / `block` / `player` map to `RECORDS` / `BLOCKS` / `PLAYERS`. Gson also accepts Java enum names for action-source values, while the schema and editor export the canonical lowercase spellings.
- `itemStack` appears in `MenuIconType` but cannot be written in JSON.
- Duplicate component ids do not reject the file. The first component with an id is used and later duplicates are ignored with a warning when a session opens.
- Only top-level `*.json` files load; subdirectories and other extensions are skipped without an error.
