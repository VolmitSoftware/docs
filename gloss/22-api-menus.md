`art.arcane.gloss.api` lets another plugin describe a holographic menu in code, put it in front of one
player, change what it says while it is on screen, receive clicks, and close it. This page is the
reference for the menu builder, the component and icon types, the session handle, click dispatch and the
two menu events. Service acquisition, dependency coordinates and the type index are in
[API: Getting Started](/gloss/21-api-getting-started).

There are two ways in, and they yield different handles:

| Goal | Call |
|---|---|
| Build the menu in code, receive clicks, change text while it is open | `open(Plugin, Player, HoloMenu)` |
| Show a menu an admin already wrote in `plugins/Gloss/menus/` | `open(Plugin, Player, String menuId)` |

A handle from the `String` overload cannot mutate anything and never receives a click. It carries
lifecycle only.

Both overloads use the player's single personal-menu slot. They do not create, query, mutate or close
panels. Panel views have their own per-viewer sessions and history; they share the public menu open and
click events documented below, but never produce a `HoloMenuHandle` or invoke an API menu click handler.
Panels are covered in [Panels](/gloss/16-panels).

## A menu is a value

```java
public record HoloMenu(String id, double offsetX, double offsetY, double offsetZ, boolean lockPosition,
                       boolean followPlayer, double maxDistance, boolean closeOnDeath,
                       boolean closeOnTeleport, List<HoloComponent> components)

public static HoloMenuBuilder builder()
```

The compact constructor sanitises `id`, requires non-null `components`, replaces the list with
`List.copyOf(components)`, and then rejects duplicate component ids. A menu is immutable and reusable:
hand the same instance to `open` as many times as you like.

### `HoloMenuBuilder`

```java
public HoloMenuBuilder id(String id)
public HoloMenuBuilder offset(double x, double y, double z)
public HoloMenuBuilder lockPosition(boolean lockPosition)
public HoloMenuBuilder followPlayer(boolean followPlayer)
public HoloMenuBuilder maxDistance(double maxDistance)
public HoloMenuBuilder closeOnDeath(boolean closeOnDeath)
public HoloMenuBuilder closeOnTeleport(boolean closeOnTeleport)
public HoloMenuBuilder component(HoloComponent component)
public HoloMenu build()
```

| Method | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `""` | Required in practice: `build()` throws `IllegalArgumentException` on the empty default |
| `offset` | `0, 0, 2` | Menu centre relative to the player, in blocks, as `x, y, z`. Not scaled by `[menus] uiScale` |
| `lockPosition` | `false` | Freezes the player in place while the menu is open. Takes priority over ordinary movement range validation |
| `followPlayer` | `false` | Re-centres the menu and tracks current yaw on every positional or rotation-only move |
| `maxDistance` | `8.0` | Range gate; see below |
| `closeOnDeath` | `true` | Close on `PlayerDeathEvent` |
| `closeOnTeleport` | `true` | Close on any teleport |
| `component` | empty list | Appends one component; call repeatedly |

Every setter returns the builder. No setter validates or sanitises: `id` stores the raw string,
`component` accepts anything including a duplicate id or `null`, and all validation happens in `build()` —
that is, in the `HoloMenu` compact constructor `build()` calls.

The builder is mutable and not thread-safe. `build()` may be called more than once; each call produces an
independent `HoloMenu` from the builder's current state.

Throw sites reachable from `build()`:

| Condition | Thrown |
|---|---|
| `id` is `null` | `IllegalArgumentException("id must not be null")` |
| No character of `id` survives filtering | `IllegalArgumentException("id must contain at least one of A-Z a-z 0-9 _ - .")` |
| `components` is `null` | `NullPointerException("components")` |
| A component in the list is `null` | `NullPointerException` from `List.copyOf` |
| Two components share a sanitised id | `IllegalArgumentException("duplicate component id: …")` |

`List.copyOf` runs before the distinct-id check, so a null element always produces the
`NullPointerException` and never reaches the id validation.

### Range gate

The session closes with `HoloCloseReason.MOVED_OUT_OF_RANGE` when the player's location fails
`centerPoint.distanceSquared(loc) <= maxDistance² + offsetLengthSquared`, where `offsetLengthSquared` is
the squared length of the menu-level offset. The menu's own standoff is therefore slack on top of
`maxDistance`. Leaving the menu's world fails the same test and closes the session. For an ordinary move
event, `lockPosition` rewrites the destination back to the origin, zeroes any non-zero velocity and
returns before this range check; teleport and respawn keep their separate range and close checks.

### Coordinate frame

Offsets are player-relative, captured from the player's yaw at the instant the menu opens: `+X` right,
`+Y` up, `+Z` in front. The frame does not re-orient afterwards, so walking around an open menu walks
around a fixed object. A button's collision plane is re-aimed at the player's eye every tick, so a button
stays clickable from any angle it is visible from.

The menu-level `offset(...)` is applied verbatim: `MenuTransform#menuOrigin` places it at a local scale of
`1`. Component offsets go through `componentPosition`, which multiplies them by the transform's scale —
`[menus] uiScale` from `config.toml`, default `1.0`, clamped to `0.25 .. 4.0`. A menu laid out at
`uiScale = 1.0` therefore spreads or tightens when an operator changes it, while the overall standoff
distance stays put. `[debug] hitbox` and `[debug] position` draw button hitboxes and anchors as
particles. No other configuration knob affects API menus.

### Id sanitisation

`HoloText.sanitizeId` is applied to `HoloMenu#id` and to every component id.

- Allowed characters are `A-Z a-z 0-9 _ - .`; every other character is dropped, not replaced.
- The result is truncated to the first 64 allowed characters (`HoloText.MAX_ID_LENGTH`).

Because filtering is silent, `"stock count"` becomes `"stockcount"`, and `handle.setText("stock count", …)`
then returns `false` because the component is registered under the name that survived. Keep every id
inside the allowed set and the two can never diverge.

Component ids must be unique within a menu. The only throw site is the `HoloMenu` compact constructor;
`HoloMenuBuilder#component` performs no validation.

A menu id that collides with a file in `plugins/Gloss/menus/` is a live hazard: Gloss closes every
personal session whose id exactly matches a changed or deleted file, with
`HoloCloseReason.DEFINITION_RELOADED`, including API-built sessions. Namespace your ids
(`exampleshop.store`, not `shop`).

## Components

```java
public sealed interface HoloComponent permits HoloComponent.Decoration, HoloComponent.Button {
  float DEFAULT_HIGHLIGHT_MODIFIER = 0.05F;

  String id();
  double offsetX();
  double offsetY();
  double offsetZ();
  HoloIcon icon();

  record Decoration(String id, double offsetX, double offsetY, double offsetZ, HoloIcon icon)
      implements HoloComponent {}

  record Button(String id, double offsetX, double offsetY, double offsetZ, HoloIcon icon,
                float highlightModifier, HoloClickHandler handler) implements HoloComponent {}

  static HoloComponent decoration(String id, double x, double y, double z, HoloIcon icon);
  static HoloComponent button(String id, double x, double y, double z, HoloIcon icon,
                              HoloClickHandler handler);
}
```

A decoration draws and nothing else: no hitbox, no clicks. A button has a hitbox derived from its icon,
leans toward the player when selected, and calls your handler on an accepted main-hand left or right
click. Text and image hitboxes are centred on the visible glyph stack rather than the logical anchor, so
aiming at what is drawn is what activates the button. Component offsets are relative to the menu centre,
in the same right/up/forward frame.

Constraints:

- Both records sanitise `id`. A `null` id throws `IllegalArgumentException`, not `NullPointerException`.
- Both records reject a null `icon` with `NullPointerException("icon")`, and `Button` rejects a null
  `handler` with `NullPointerException("handler")`.
- `highlightModifier` — how far, in blocks, the icon leans toward the player when selected — is clamped
  into `0.0F .. 1.0F`; a non-finite value becomes `0.0F`. The `button(...)` factory supplies
  `DEFAULT_HIGHLIGHT_MODIFIER` (`0.05F`); use the canonical constructor to choose your own.

```java
new HoloComponent.Button("close", 0.0D, -0.6D, 0.0D, HoloIcon.text("<red>[X]"), 0.2F,
    click -> click.handle().close());
```

API-authored buttons always use automatic, icon-derived hitbox dimensions and button-anchored alignment.
The `hitbox` overrides available to file-backed JSON buttons, described in
[Components & Hitboxes](/gloss/10-components-hitboxes), have no API equivalent. Toggle components, which
JSON menus can declare, likewise have no API form: `HoloComponent` permits only `Decoration` and `Button`.

## Icons

```java
public sealed interface HoloIcon permits HoloIcon.Text, HoloIcon.Item, HoloIcon.Block, HoloIcon.Image,
                                         HoloIcon.AnimatedImage, HoloIcon.Entity {
  record Text(String miniMessage) implements HoloIcon {}
  record Item(ItemStack stack) implements HoloIcon {}
  record Block(Material material) implements HoloIcon {}
  record Image(String relativePath) implements HoloIcon {}
  record AnimatedImage(List<String> relativePaths, int tickSpeed) implements HoloIcon {}
  record Entity(EntityType entityType, float width, float height) implements HoloIcon {}

  static HoloIcon text(String miniMessage);
  static HoloIcon item(ItemStack stack);
  static HoloIcon block(Material material);
  static HoloIcon image(String relativePath);
  static HoloIcon animatedImage(List<String> relativePaths, int tickSpeed);
  static HoloIcon entity(EntityType entityType, float width, float height);
}
```

| Shape | Renders | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `Text` | MiniMessage markup; `\n` splits into stacked lines | Truncated at 4096 characters. Every control character except `\n` becomes a space. `null` and `""` both become `""`, which is legal and renders nothing |
| `Item` | A floating item display | `NullPointerException("stack")` on null. Cloned on construction and on every `stack()` read, so your `ItemStack` stays yours to mutate |
| `Block` | A packet-only block display using the default state | Non-null Bukkit material; a live server rejects any material whose `isBlock()` is false |
| `Image` | A picture from `plugins/Gloss/images/` | `IllegalArgumentException` when blank, over 256 characters, containing a control character or `:`, starting with `/`, or containing a `..` segment. `\` becomes `/` |
| `AnimatedImage` | Those frames in order, advancing every `tickSpeed` ticks | Every path sanitised as above; list copied; empty or null list rejected with `IllegalArgumentException`; `tickSpeed` clamped to at least `1` |
| `Entity` | A packet-only living entity anchored at its feet | Non-null Bukkit type with `isSpawnable()` and `isAlive()`; width and height must be finite, greater than `0`, and no larger than `64` |

The image path validation messages name the directory they describe:
`"image path must be relative to the Gloss images folder (plugins/Gloss/images/)"` and
`"image path must not escape the Gloss images folder (plugins/Gloss/images/)"`.

Text is parsed by `TextUtils.parse`, which translates legacy `&` and `§` codes into their MiniMessage tag
equivalents first and then deserialises the whole string as MiniMessage. Both spellings work in one
string.

If your `ItemStack` subclass throws from `clone()`, that exception propagates out of `open`. An image file
that is missing or unreadable at render time does not fail the open: Gloss logs it and draws a visible
placeholder in that slot.

Entity width and height define automatic click geometry rather than client-model scale. Entity icons
receive the session's yaw, pitch and head yaw, move with the menu, and are destroyed client-side when the
icon closes, without ever creating a Bukkit world entity. Block icons never create or mutate a Bukkit
world block.

### The `itemStack` icon is API-only

`HoloIcon.Item` translates to `ItemStackIconData`, whose `MenuIconType` is `ITEM_STACK` with the
serialized name `itemStack`. That enum constant carries a `null` data class, so the JSON icon
deserialiser cannot construct it: `itemStack` is not a value a menu document may write. Every other
`HoloIcon` shape maps onto an icon type that documents can also express — `text`, `block`, `textImage`,
`animatedTextImage` and `entity`. Document icons additionally have `item` and `customItem`, which have no
API form; see [Icons](/gloss/11-icons) and [Custom Items & Item Providers](/gloss/14-custom-items).

The practical consequence: a live `ItemStack`, with its own meta, enchantments and components, can only
reach a menu through the API. `HoloIcon.item(stack)` clones the stack on construction and again on every
read, so nothing you hand Gloss is shared.

## Opening, closing and querying

```java
public interface GlossAPI {
  HoloMenuHandle open(Plugin owner, Player player, HoloMenu menu);
  HoloMenuHandle open(Plugin owner, Player player, String menuId);
  boolean close(Player player);
  boolean isOpen(Player player);
  Set<String> menuIds();
}
```

These five methods used to live on a separate `HoloUiService` interface. They are now part of
`GlossAPI`, which is also the type registered on the `ServicesManager`; see
[API: Getting Started](/gloss/21-api-getting-started).

`open` never returns null. An ordinary refusal comes back as a handle that is already terminal, with the
reason delivered to the close callback. It throws in exactly two cases:

- A null `owner`, `player`, `menu` or `menuId` raises `NullPointerException`.
- An exception thrown while translating your menu, such as an `ItemStack.clone()` failure, propagates to
  the caller. No handle is registered and nothing is left behind.

`close(Player)` and `isOpen(Player)` tolerate a null player and answer `false`.

`owner` is your plugin instance. Gloss captures `owner.getName()` and a `BooleanSupplier` bound to
`owner::isEnabled` (`ApiOwner`), and uses them to name you in logs and in
`GlossMenuOpenEvent#getOwnerPluginName`, to skip your handlers once you are disabled, and to close your
menus when your plugin unloads.

### The two overloads are not equivalent

| | `open(…, HoloMenu)` | `open(…, String menuId)` |
|---|---|---|
| Menu source | your code | `plugins/Gloss/menus/<menuId>.json` |
| Permission check | none | `gloss.open.<menuId>` on the player |
| Click handlers | yours, dispatched to you | the JSON file's own actions; nothing reaches your code |
| `setText` / `setItem` / `setIcon` | work | always return `false` |
| `handle.menuId()` | the sanitised `menu.id()` | exactly the string you passed |

The `String` overload constructs the handle with an empty handler map and an empty component-id set, so
every setter refuses and no click is ever routed to you. What you get is a lifecycle handle: `state()`,
`onClosed(…)`, `close()`.

The id lookup is an exact `ConcurrentHashMap` containment check against the loaded menu registry, whose
keys are case-preserving slash-separated paths relative to `menus/` without the final `.json`. `"Welcome"`
will not find `welcome.json`, and `shop` will not find `shops/shop.json`; a miss terminates the handle
with `HoloCloseReason.DENIED`. `menuIds()` returns a copy of the loaded ids.

The permission check is `player.hasPermission("gloss.open." + definition.getId())`, where the loaded
definition's id is that relative path — identical to the key you passed, since the lookup is exact.
`plugin.yml` does not declare `gloss.open` or any `gloss.open.*` child. The per-menu node is runtime-only;
Bukkit's default for undeclared permissions is op-only, so operators pass and everyone else needs an
explicit grant from a permission plugin. There is no parent wildcard. See
[Commands & Permissions](/gloss/17-commands-permissions).

A cancelled `GlossMenuOpenEvent` is checked separately, after the permission gate, and also produces
`DENIED`.

### One menu per player

A player has at most one menu open. Opening a second prepares and opens a replacement while the first
remains attached; only after success does the holder commit the swap, close the old session, and end its
handle with `HoloCloseReason.REPLACED`. If construction or component opening fails, partial display
entities are cleaned up, the old session and its handle remain live, and the incoming API handle ends as
`OPEN_FAILED`. If the player is offline when the open task runs, the new handle terminates with `QUIT` and
the existing session is left alone.

`close(Player)` closes whatever that player has open, whoever opened it, with `CLOSED_BY_OWNER`;
`/gloss menu close` does the same with `CLOSED_BY_COMMAND`. `close` returns `false` when there was nothing
to close and `true` when the teardown was accepted onto the player's entity scheduler — accepted, not
necessarily already run.

To close only your own session, use `handle.close()`. It routes through `destroySessionFor`, which
compares session identity, so it no-ops when the player's current session is not this handle's.

### Why `open` resolves inline on the owning thread

`open` never reads the player's world state on your thread — the only thing it takes from the `Player`
before dispatch is the UUID. Everything else runs inside a task submitted through
`FoliaScheduler.runEntity(plugin, player, task, 0L, retired)`. That call runs the task inline when the
delay is zero and the entity is owned by the calling region, and otherwise submits it to the entity
scheduler. Two consequences:

1. Called from the owning thread, the whole open resolves before `open` returns and the handle is already
   `OPEN`, `CLOSED` or `FAILED`. Called from anywhere else, you get a `PENDING` handle and the menu
   appears a tick or more later. Code that reads `handle.state()` immediately after `open` is correct on
   one thread and wrong on the other, with no error either way.
2. Gloss cannot protect the code around your call. If you built the `HoloMenu` from the player's inventory
   or a nearby block on an async thread, you already read world state illegally.

To hop explicitly (`Bukkit.isOwnedByCurrentRegion` and `Entity#getScheduler()` are Paper API — present on
Paper and Folia, absent on plain Spigot):

```java
if (Bukkit.isOwnedByCurrentRegion(player)) {
    gloss.open(plugin, player, menu);
} else {
    player.getScheduler().run(plugin, task -> gloss.open(plugin, player, menu), null);
}
```

When the entity scheduler refuses the task on Folia, Gloss logs a warning, refuses the global fallback,
and the handle terminates `FAILED` with `OPEN_FAILED`. On non-Folia servers the same refusal falls back to
`SchedulerUtils.runGlobal`, which runs the open on the main thread.

## Handles and state

```java
public interface HoloMenuHandle {
  UUID sessionId();
  UUID playerId();
  String menuId();
  HoloMenuState state();
  boolean setText(String componentId, String miniMessage);
  boolean setItem(String componentId, ItemStack stack);
  boolean setIcon(String componentId, HoloIcon icon);
  void close();
  HoloMenuHandle onClosed(Consumer<HoloCloseReason> callback);
}

public enum HoloMenuState {
  PENDING, OPEN, CLOSED, FAILED;
  public boolean terminal();   // true for CLOSED and FAILED
}
```

### Lifecycle

```
open(...)  ->  handle, never null
   |
   v
PENDING ---- session created ----> OPEN
   |                                |
   +---------------+----------------+
                   |  exactly one close reason
          +--------+--------+
          v                 v
       FAILED             CLOSED
  DENIED, OPEN_FAILED   every other reason
```

Guarantees, implemented in `ApiHandleState` over a single `AtomicReference<Snapshot>`:

- A handle is one session. It is never reused or reopened; `sessionId()` is a fresh `UUID` per handle. A
  second `open` for the same player yields a different handle.
- State moves forward only. `markOpen()` is a compare-and-set that succeeds only from `PENDING`, so
  `PENDING → OPEN` happens at most once. `PENDING → CLOSED/FAILED` skips `OPEN` when the open never lands.
- Termination is exactly once. `terminate` CAS-loops until the snapshot is terminal; the first reason
  wins, and every later attempt returns `false` and never reaches your callback.
- `FAILED` means the menu was never on screen. Exactly two reasons produce it: `DENIED` and `OPEN_FAILED`.
  Every other reason produces `CLOSED`.
- A handle does not survive the player leaving. `PlayerQuitEvent` closes the session with `QUIT`, and a
  player who logs out before a `PENDING` open lands also gets `QUIT`, delivered through the entity
  scheduler's retired callback. There is no reattach on rejoin.
- A handle does not survive your plugin disabling; see
  [API: Getting Started](/gloss/21-api-getting-started).

| `HoloMenuState` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PENDING` | Accepted, not yet on screen. Setters are accepted and staged; the updates apply on the first tick after open |
| `OPEN` | On screen |
| `CLOSED` | It was on screen and is not any more, or it ended before opening for a non-failure reason |
| `FAILED` | It never reached the player. Only `DENIED` and `OPEN_FAILED` produce this |

### `HoloCloseReason`

| Constant | Resulting state | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `CLOSED_BY_OWNER` | `CLOSED` | `handle.close()` or `GlossAPI.close(Player)` |
| `CLOSED_BY_COMMAND` | `CLOSED` | `/gloss menu close`, and the internal close path the navigation code uses |
| `REPLACED` | `CLOSED` | Another menu opened for the same player |
| `MOVED_OUT_OF_RANGE` | `CLOSED` | The player failed the range gate, including leaving the world |
| `DEATH` | `CLOSED` | The player died and `closeOnDeath` was set |
| `RESPAWN` | `CLOSED` | The respawn point was out of range. Only reachable with `closeOnDeath(false)` |
| `TELEPORT` | `CLOSED` | The player teleported and `closeOnTeleport` was set, or landed out of range |
| `QUIT` | `CLOSED` | The player logged out, including before a `PENDING` open landed |
| `DEFINITION_RELOADED` | `CLOSED` | A JSON menu whose id exactly matches this session's changed or was deleted |
| `OWNER_DISABLED` | `CLOSED` | The plugin that opened the menu was disabled |
| `DENIED` | `FAILED` | Unknown menu id, missing `gloss.open.<id>`, a cancelled `GlossMenuOpenEvent`, or `[features] menus` off |
| `OPEN_FAILED` | `FAILED` | Gloss was shut down, the scheduler refused the task, or the open threw |
| `GLOSS_SHUTDOWN` | `CLOSED` | Gloss disabled or unloaded while the menu was open |

Both enums may gain constants; always write a `default` arm over either one, or use
`HoloMenuState.terminal()`.

### The close callback

```java
HoloMenuHandle onClosed(Consumer<HoloCloseReason> callback);
```

- Returns the handle, so it chains onto `open`.
- There is one callback slot (`AtomicReference`). Registering a second replaces the first; passing `null`
  clears it.
- It fires exactly once. `fire` uses `getAndSet(null)`, so Gloss drops the reference the moment it fires.
  Registering on an already-terminal handle fires immediately and inline, with the stored reason. That is
  what makes this ordering correct even when `open` resolved synchronously:

  ```java
  HoloMenuHandle handle = gloss.open(plugin, player, menu);
  live.put(player.getUniqueId(), handle);
  handle.onClosed(reason -> live.remove(player.getUniqueId()));
  ```

  Publish the handle first, then register. If the open already failed, the callback runs before `onClosed`
  returns and cleans up the entry you just wrote.
- The callback runs on whichever thread terminated the handle: the player's region thread in the ordinary
  cases, the `PlayerQuitEvent` thread on quit, Gloss's disable thread on shutdown, and your own thread for
  a late registration. Treat it as bookkeeping only and schedule world work onto the player's entity
  scheduler.
- If your callback throws, Gloss logs one `WARNING` naming your plugin and continues. The exception never
  reaches the session teardown.

## Changing what is on screen

```java
boolean setText(String componentId, String miniMessage);   // wraps HoloIcon.text
boolean setItem(String componentId, ItemStack stack);      // wraps HoloIcon.item
boolean setIcon(String componentId, HoloIcon icon);
```

Each stages a new icon for one component and returns whether it was accepted. `false` means one of:

- `componentId` is null, or is not in the component-id set the handle was built with — always the case for
  the `String` overload;
- the handle is terminal;
- for `setItem` and `setIcon` only, the value was null.

`setText(id, null)` is accepted and blanks the component, because `HoloIcon.text(null)` sanitises to `""`.

Staging is not drawing. Updates land in `ApiPendingIcons`, a `ConcurrentHashMap` plus a volatile dirty
flag. `MenuSession#drainApiUpdates()` drains it on the player's region thread at the top of the menu tick,
which runs every tick, so an accepted update is on screen within about 50 ms. Consequences:

- Updates coalesce per component. Repeated `setText` calls on the same component between two ticks produce
  one visual change carrying the last value, so driving a setter from a tight loop does not generate
  packet spam.
- `true` means accepted, not rendered. If the session ends in the same tick, `terminate` calls
  `pending.discard()` and the update is dropped.
- A staged update whose component id exists on the handle but not in the live session is silently skipped
  by the drain. That is reachable when a handle outlives a definition swap.
- If applying an icon throws, Gloss logs it and that one component keeps its previous icon; the drain and
  the session continue.

Changing text in place keeps the same display entities as long as the icon is already text and the new
markup has the same number of `\n`-separated lines; only differing lines are re-sent. Changing the line
count, or changing the kind of icon, tears the old icon down and spawns a new one. Either way a button's
hitbox is re-derived from whatever it now draws.

Text placeholders refresh while the icon is visible, and only for text that contains a paired `%name%`
token. The default interval is 10 ticks; file-backed text may set `refreshTicks: 0` to freeze the
initially rendered value, and `HoloIcon.Text` has no refresh field so API text always uses the default.
`setText` replaces the icon's source string, and later refreshes resolve that new source for the viewing
player. A refresh that throws is logged once per session and the previous text is kept. With PlaceholderAPI
absent, unresolved plugin placeholders remain literal. See
[API: Placeholders](/gloss/23-api-placeholders).

### After termination

After termination, `setText`, `setItem` and `setIcon` return `false`, `close()` is a no-op, and staged
updates are discarded. Checking `state().terminal()` first is an optimisation, not a requirement.

## Clicks

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface HoloClickHandler {
  void onClick(HoloClick click);
}

public record HoloClick(Player player, String menuId, String componentId,
                        HoloClickTrigger trigger, HoloMenuHandle handle)
```

`HoloClick` rejects a null `player`, `trigger` or `handle` with `NullPointerException`; `menuId` and
`componentId` are unchecked. `handle` is the same instance `open` returned, so a handler can mutate or
close the menu it is in with no bookkeeping. `trigger` is one of `LEFT_CLICK`, `RIGHT_CLICK`,
`SHIFT_LEFT_CLICK` or `SHIFT_RIGHT_CLICK`; `ANY` exists only for configured action matching and is never
emitted as a physical click.

### Dispatch

Gloss listens to `PlayerInteractEvent` at `EventPriority.HIGHEST` (`MenuSessionManager#dispatchClick`).
Per click:

1. Main-hand `LEFT_CLICK_AIR`, `LEFT_CLICK_BLOCK`, `RIGHT_CLICK_AIR` and `RIGHT_CLICK_BLOCK` are accepted.
   Off-hand, physical and already-cancelled events return. The action plus the current sneak state becomes
   the exact `HoloClickTrigger`.
2. Gloss ray-tests every open clickable in the player's personal menu and every eligible panel view
   against the event-time eye ray. Non-fixed billboard planes are re-oriented before testing, and the
   smallest positive intersection distance wins. An exact personal/panel tie goes to the personal menu.
3. If no plane is hit, or a block ray trace finds a closer obstruction, the event remains untouched.
   Otherwise Gloss cancels it at `HIGHEST`; lower-priority listeners have already observed the event, while
   the vanilla interaction is suppressed.
4. For the one winning component:
   - `GlossMenuClickEvent` is fired with the exact trigger. Cancellation skips both file-authored actions
     and the API handler.
   - The component's own JSON actions run through `component.onClick(trigger)`. For an API-built menu the
     action list is empty. An exception here is logged and does not suppress the API handler step.
   - If the personal-menu handle is non-null and still live, its `HoloClickHandler` for that component id
     receives a `HoloClick` with the same trigger, through the click guard. Panels have no API menu
     handler.

Handlers run on the clicking player's region thread. Reading and mutating that player's inventory,
experience and location is legal there. Do not block that thread: no I/O, no `CompletableFuture.join`, no
`callSyncMethod`, no lock held across the call. That thread ticks every entity and every open menu in the
region.

### The click guard

`ApiClickGuard` wraps every dispatch. Gloss constructs one per `MenuSessionManager` with
`ApiClickGuard.DEFAULT_FAULT_LIMIT` (`5`) and `ApiClickGuard.DEFAULT_SLOW_MILLIS` (`5`), keyed by plugin
name. `dispatch` returns an `ApiClickOutcome`:

| Outcome | When |
|---|---|
| `DISPATCHED` | The handler ran and returned normally |
| `FAULTED` | The handler, or the `isEnabled()` probe, threw a `Throwable` |
| `NO_HANDLER` | No handler is registered for that component id |
| `SKIPPED_OWNER_DISABLED` | `owner.active()` returned `false` |
| `SKIPPED_QUARANTINED` | The owning plugin is quarantined |

Behaviour:

- Faults. A throwing handler is logged at `WARNING` naming your plugin, the component and the menu, and
  the click is swallowed. The owner's fault counter increments. `Plugin#isEnabled()` throwing counts as a
  fault too, and the handler is not called.
- Quarantine. At `DEFAULT_FAULT_LIMIT` (5) accumulated faults, the plugin is quarantined: one `SEVERE` log
  line, and its handlers are no longer called. Its menus stay on screen and still close normally. Fault
  counts are never decayed, so quarantine is reached by lifetime total, not by a rate.
- Slow-handler warning. A dispatch taking `DEFAULT_SLOW_MILLIS` (5 ms) or more logs one `WARNING` per
  plugin per 60 seconds. It never changes the outcome. The timing window also covers the `owner.active()`
  probe.
- Reset. `forget(ownerName)` clears quarantine, fault count and slow-warning timestamp. Gloss calls it from
  `PluginDisableEvent` for the disabling plugin, so a quarantined plugin that is disabled starts clean when
  it comes back. The whole guard is also replaced whenever Gloss restarts its menu session manager.

`ApiClickOutcome` and the guard's counters (`dispatches()`, `faults()`, `skips()`, `quarantines()`) are
internal telemetry and are not reachable from the API.

## Menu events

Both events extend `org.bukkit.event.Event` directly with their own `HandlerList`; there is no shared base
class. Both are constructed with the no-arg `Event()` superconstructor and are therefore synchronous
events — where "synchronous" on Folia means "on whichever region thread fired it", not "on the main
thread". The third API event, `GlossContainerPreviewAccessEvent`, is in
[API: Previews](/gloss/24-api-previews).

### `GlossMenuOpenEvent`

```java
public GlossMenuOpenEvent(Player player, String menuId, String ownerPluginName)
public Player getPlayer()
public String getMenuId()
public String getOwnerPluginName()
public boolean isCancelled()
public void setCancelled(boolean cancel)
public HandlerList getHandlers()
public static HandlerList getHandlerList()
```

Fired immediately before a menu session is created, on the player's region thread. Personal root opens
fire from `MenuSessionManager#createNewSession`; personal push, replace, back and home navigation fire from
`MenuSessionManager#navigateSession`. Panel root admission and panel navigation fire separately from
`PanelViewSession#openMenu`. Those paths cover every personal and panel menu open, including
`/gloss menu open`, `/gloss menu back`, API opens and native navigation.

`getOwnerPluginName()` is the opening plugin's name, or `null` for a menu Gloss opened itself — every
panel open is `null`. `getMenuId()` is the resolved definition id. A null `player` throws
`NullPointerException`.

Cancelling it prevents that personal or panel menu from opening. For a root API open, `createNewSession`
returns `false` and the handle terminates `FAILED` with `DENIED`; a cancelled navigation leaves the current
menu and history intact, while a cancelled panel root admission leaves that panel view unopened and
eligible for a later runtime retry.

### `GlossMenuClickEvent`

```java
public GlossMenuClickEvent(Player player, String menuId, String componentId,
                           String ownerPluginName, HoloClickTrigger trigger)
public Player getPlayer()
public String getMenuId()
public String getComponentId()
public String getOwnerPluginName()
public HoloClickTrigger getTrigger()
public boolean isCancelled()
public void setCancelled(boolean cancel)
public HandlerList getHandlers()
public static HandlerList getHandlerList()
```

Fired for the one nearest hit component, before its actions and handler run, on the clicking player's
region thread. It also fires for panel components, whose owner name is null. Cancelling it makes that
component do nothing for this click. A null `player` or `trigger` throws `NullPointerException`.

### Dispatch cost and failure

`ApiEvents` checks `getHandlerList().getRegisteredListeners().length == 0` first and skips dispatch
entirely when no listener is registered, so an unused event costs nothing. If the dispatch itself throws,
Gloss logs it and treats the event as not cancelled.

```java
package com.example.shop;

import art.arcane.gloss.api.GlossMenuClickEvent;
import art.arcane.gloss.api.GlossMenuOpenEvent;
import org.bukkit.event.EventHandler;
import org.bukkit.event.Listener;
import org.bukkit.plugin.Plugin;

public final class MenuWatcher implements Listener {
  private final Plugin plugin;

  public MenuWatcher(Plugin plugin) {
    this.plugin = plugin;
  }

  @EventHandler(ignoreCancelled = true)
  public void onMenuOpen(GlossMenuOpenEvent event) {
    if ("welcome".equals(event.getMenuId()) && event.getPlayer().hasPermission("example.veteran")) {
      event.setCancelled(true);
    }
  }

  @EventHandler(ignoreCancelled = true)
  public void onMenuClick(GlossMenuClickEvent event) {
    if (event.getOwnerPluginName() == null) {
      return;
    }

    plugin.getLogger().info(event.getPlayer().getName() + " used " + event.getTrigger()
        + " on " + event.getComponentId() + " in " + event.getMenuId()
        + " owned by " + event.getOwnerPluginName());
  }
}
```

## Complete example

A shop that hands out emeralds, rewrites its own stock line, and closes itself when the stock runs out.

### The menu

```java
package com.example.shop;

import art.arcane.gloss.api.GlossAPI;
import art.arcane.gloss.api.HoloClick;
import art.arcane.gloss.api.HoloCloseReason;
import art.arcane.gloss.api.HoloComponent;
import art.arcane.gloss.api.HoloIcon;
import art.arcane.gloss.api.HoloMenu;
import art.arcane.gloss.api.HoloMenuHandle;
import art.arcane.gloss.api.HoloMenuState;
import org.bukkit.Material;
import org.bukkit.entity.Player;
import org.bukkit.inventory.ItemStack;
import org.bukkit.plugin.Plugin;

import java.util.Map;
import java.util.UUID;
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

public final class ShopMenu {
  private static final String MENU_ID = "exampleshop.store";
  private static final String STOCK_ID = "stock";

  private final Plugin plugin;
  private final GlossAPI gloss;
  private final Map<UUID, HoloMenuHandle> live = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
  private final Map<UUID, Integer> stock = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

  public ShopMenu(Plugin plugin, GlossAPI gloss) {
    this.plugin = plugin;
    this.gloss = gloss;
  }

  public void open(Player player) {
    int remaining = stock.computeIfAbsent(player.getUniqueId(), id -> 3);

    HoloMenu menu = HoloMenu.builder()
        .id(MENU_ID)
        .offset(0.0D, 0.6D, 2.5D)
        .maxDistance(6.0D)
        .closeOnDeath(true)
        .closeOnTeleport(true)
        .component(HoloComponent.decoration("title", 0.0D, 0.85D, 0.0D,
            HoloIcon.text("<gold><bold>Village Store")))
        .component(HoloComponent.decoration(STOCK_ID, 0.0D, 0.55D, 0.0D,
            HoloIcon.text("<gray>Emeralds left: " + remaining)))
        .component(HoloComponent.button("buy", 0.0D, 0.0D, 0.0D,
            HoloIcon.item(new ItemStack(Material.EMERALD)), this::onBuy))
        .component(new HoloComponent.Button("close", 0.0D, -0.6D, 0.0D,
            HoloIcon.text("<red>[X]"), 0.2F, click -> click.handle().close()))
        .build();

    HoloMenuHandle handle = gloss.open(plugin, player, menu);
    live.put(player.getUniqueId(), handle);
    handle.onClosed(reason -> onClosed(player.getUniqueId(), reason));
  }

  public boolean isShowing(Player player) {
    HoloMenuHandle handle = live.get(player.getUniqueId());
    return handle != null && handle.state() == HoloMenuState.OPEN;
  }

  private void onBuy(HoloClick click) {
    UUID playerId = click.player().getUniqueId();
    int remaining = stock.merge(playerId, -1, (current, delta) -> Math.max(0, current + delta));

    click.player().getInventory().addItem(new ItemStack(Material.EMERALD));
    click.handle().setText(STOCK_ID, "<gray>Emeralds left: " + remaining);

    if (remaining <= 0) {
      click.handle().close();
    }
  }

  private void onClosed(UUID playerId, HoloCloseReason reason) {
    live.remove(playerId);

    if (reason == HoloCloseReason.DENIED || reason == HoloCloseReason.OPEN_FAILED) {
      plugin.getLogger().warning("Shop menu for " + playerId + " never opened: " + reason);
    }
  }
}
```

The stock decoration carries no placeholder; its value moves because `onBuy` pushes a new string through
the handle. `onBuy` touches the player's inventory directly, which is legal because a click handler
already runs on that player's region thread.

### Triggering it

A player-issued command runs on the player's own region thread on Folia and on the main thread on Paper
and Spigot, so `open` resolves inline and the returned handle is already settled.

```java
package com.example.shop;

import org.bukkit.command.Command;
import org.bukkit.command.CommandExecutor;
import org.bukkit.command.CommandSender;
import org.bukkit.entity.Player;

public final class ShopCommand implements CommandExecutor {
  private final ShopMenu shopMenu;

  public ShopCommand(ShopMenu shopMenu) {
    this.shopMenu = shopMenu;
  }

  @Override
  public boolean onCommand(CommandSender sender, Command command, String label, String[] args) {
    if (!(sender instanceof Player player)) {
      sender.sendMessage("Only a player can open the shop.");
      return true;
    }

    shopMenu.open(player);
    return true;
  }
}
```

### Wiring it up

```java
package com.example.shop;

import art.arcane.gloss.api.GlossAPI;
import org.bukkit.Bukkit;
import org.bukkit.command.PluginCommand;
import org.bukkit.plugin.RegisteredServiceProvider;
import org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPlugin;

public final class ExampleShopPlugin extends JavaPlugin {

  @Override
  public void onEnable() {
    RegisteredServiceProvider<GlossAPI> registration =
        Bukkit.getServicesManager().getRegistration(GlossAPI.class);

    if (registration == null) {
      getLogger().warning("Gloss is not installed; the shop menu is unavailable.");
      return;
    }

    ShopMenu shopMenu = new ShopMenu(this, registration.getProvider());
    PluginCommand command = getCommand("shop");

    if (command != null) {
      command.setExecutor(new ShopCommand(shopMenu));
    }
  }
}
```

There is nothing to unregister for menus: Gloss closes every menu you own when your plugin disables.

### Showing an admin-authored menu

```java
public void show(Player player) {
  if (!gloss.menuIds().contains("welcome")) {
    return;
  }

  HoloMenuHandle handle = gloss.open(plugin, player, "welcome");
  handle.onClosed(reason -> plugin.getLogger().info("welcome closed: " + reason));
}
```

The player still needs `gloss.open.welcome`. The handle reports lifecycle and can end the session; it
cannot change the menu or hear its clicks.

## Failure isolation and consumer lifecycle

The API isolates callback failures and owner shutdown where it can. Blocking callbacks still block the
player's owning thread and are reported only after they return.

| Misbehaviour | What Gloss does |
|---|---|
| A click handler throws (`Exception` or `Error`) | Counted as a fault, logged at `WARNING` naming your plugin, the component and the menu; click swallowed |
| A click handler is slow | One `WARNING` per plugin per 60 s once a dispatch takes 5 ms or more. Never changes the outcome |
| 5 accumulated faults from one plugin | That plugin is quarantined: one `SEVERE` line, and its handlers stop being called. Its menus stay open |
| A quarantined plugin disables | Quarantine, fault count and slow-warning timestamp are cleared on `PluginDisableEvent` |
| `Plugin#isEnabled()` throws on the owner | Counted as a fault; the handler is not called |
| Your plugin disables with menus open | Every session you own closes with `OWNER_DISABLED` |
| A close callback throws | One `WARNING` naming your plugin. Teardown continues |
| `ItemStack.clone()` throws during translation | Propagates out of `open`; no handle is registered and nothing is left behind |
| Session construction or component opening throws | Partial entities, session state, placeholder state and telemetry are cleaned up; the previous session is restored; the incoming handle terminates `FAILED` with `OPEN_FAILED` |
| The open task throws for another reason | Logged at `SEVERE` naming your plugin and the player; the handle terminates `FAILED` with `OPEN_FAILED` |
| `setText`/`setItem`/`setIcon` with a bad id | Returns `false`. Nothing logged, nothing staged |
| A staged update for a component the session lacks | Silently skipped by the drain; the session continues |
| An icon update throws while being applied | Logged; that component keeps its previous icon and the session continues |
| The entity scheduler refuses the task on Folia | Logged at `WARNING`. Gloss refuses the global fallback and fails the handle with `OPEN_FAILED` |
| The entity scheduler retires the task | The handle terminates with `QUIT` |

No value moves through this API. Gloss never takes or gives items, currency or experience on anyone's
behalf, and a menu you build in code carries no actions but your own handlers. The one thing that does
execute on your say-so is the `String` overload: an admin-authored menu runs the actions written in its
JSON file, which may include commands dispatched as the player or as console, gated only by
`gloss.open.<menuId>`. See [Actions](/gloss/12-actions).

Text supplied through the API is intentionally parsed as markup. Before parsing it is truncated to 4096
characters and control characters other than newlines are replaced with spaces. Ids are filtered to a
fixed character set, image paths are constrained to `plugins/Gloss/images/`, and each menu's packets are
sent only to its owning player.
